I had trouble focusing on my guided meditation app, Balance. I felt angry because I fed into my own anger, which caused me to switch my focus around to divert my attention from which part of my body I was focusing on, along with some angry thought patterns. For example, I was trying to focus on my breath as the guide instructed, however, I misdirected myself intentionally by focusing elsewhere. It was to punish myself for getting distracted on a driver's manual, which itself was a punishment for a mistake at work today.  


During meditation today, I began shifting my awareness around, distracting myself with angry thoughts, and attempted to go back to my internal dialogues and roleplaying internally. As I am currently writing this, I have just spent a night at my apartment after being discharged. I experienced a failure when I went to work this morning and that caused my thoughts and behaviors to spiral and regress back to how I acted in the hospital. I was terribly angry with myself due to feeling as though I let my client down, and tried to punish myself for making the mistake. My client complained that I wasn't showing up to work and we discussed prior that I would skip work on Wednesday, and I wasn't keeping enough track of my personal responsibilities due to improperly dealing with my emotions and distracting myself. Mistakes are natural, big or small, but my issue is that I get angry with a mistake I make, and regress into pretending that either the mistake never happened, or not brushing it aside and fixing it to instead ruminate on it and go into loops. It also happens for things that aren't mistakes, like sharing information about myself with others online or in person. In the hospital and in general, I've been treating my life and behaviors as a game despite wanting and intending to take it seriously. One of the issues this causes me is that I've been desperately wanting to stop my constant nonstop pretending and open my mind to the world and other people, and I would often disassociate or concoct a narrative spontaneously to explain simple body functions. I ended up attributing my blinking and swallowing manually as me repressing something, like a lie or attempts to regress so that I end up in a thought loop and blinking to notice a mistake and fix it. While in the hospital, I even started nodding as I had dialogue with myself, constantly pretending that I was in school to help with emotions. These and similar habits continuously made me more and more frustrated, which caused me to continue to do it out of anger. Outwardly, I have been incredibly stable, while inwardly, I continued to find ways to keep thinking to annoy myself to prevent any potential stressful thoughts.   


I've been in and out of the hospital due to suicidal and homicidal ideation over the last few months. My therapist believes I may have OCD tendencies, and I recognize these tendencies quite a lot as well. A lot of it comes from fear and anger, however. I sometimes intentionally try to scare myself with my thoughts, or set harsh rules and guidelines for myself internally or on paper to try and control my actions, despite knowing that most things I do come naturally. I gave myself a time limit until noon to write all of this just now, and now that it's twelve minutes after, I'm angry about my self-imposed time limit, because I took multiple breaks and began stalling. It was to show me by example some of my past behavior. I'm finding excuses to complain about myself and my past behavior, criticizing every mistake, and when I justify these things with understanding that it was my past behavior or fix the mistake as I both want and need to, I would deny it and criticize myself harshly regardless out of what I speculate is some form of masochism. I know it isn't okay to treat myself this way, and I know I don't want to treat myself this way. I played with my life before my last hospital visit, and that upset me deeply.  


I've been pretending that my anger is a demon and because I've been making things hard on myself by trying to regress, I selectively recalled information to fit my wants instead of my needs without considering how I think differently when I'm angry and pretended that I actually was a demon to make myself angry and deceive myself. I started thinking ""this is how we communicate"" when I scratch itches, because I was forcing myself not to do my pretending or roleplaying when I was too anxious, stressed or angry. I'm trying to go back in time to re-experience the good and bad parts of my life, and I've been showing it to myself through subconcious actions or suggestions that I already know, but chose to be unaware of because they can remind me of unpleasant times. It was also done inversely with good things. Two examples include right now and yesterday night. Just a moment ago, I reminded myself of my past Vyvanse abuse by shifting my awareness to how much time I had spent typing this out. It's been about 6ish hours. I really see the issue with spending so much time avoiding problems and now it's affecting me and my job performance. I've been using a lot of reframing to help change my point of view on things, but I've been doing it improperly. I've been going back and forth with myself to reframe negative things as positive, sometimes getting angry and reframing improperly because I've been arguing with myself or giving into my anger. The goal of reframing is seeing things, people and events as neutral so that I can view things objectively and understand how to improve, instead of dwelling on the negatives. I've also been confusing neutrality with not caring. Sometimes I tell myself that I don't care about certain things that bother me, despite knowing that I do care. I know I care, but when I get angry or afraid, it becomes easier to lie to myself or construct a narrative to protect my ego.   


Since moving from my childhood home to my apartment on February 15, I've been in a state of constant roleplaying and pretending with myself due to wanting an escape from my life, my family, my self and my identity. In the past, I would use drugs like Vyvanse, Adderall, cannabis or just about anything I could get my hands on from the comfort of my home. I had terrible agoraphobia, (undiagnosed, but VERY extreme.) and isolated myself from the world. I finished high school around the same time the COVID-19 pandemic started, and because I already had little to no motivation or aspiration to do anything in life other than seek pleasure, I ended up spiraling into several bad habits. I would constantly look over my shoulder in my own bedroom, worried that my brother or mother would walk in on me watching pornography in excess. I was afraid and worried that my  brother would walk in on me in the bathroom every time I went to poop. I hated my mother and brother. He and my mother would often invalidate my feelings, and make me feel like my emotions didn't matter. I reached a point where I was in bed, not engaging with any kind of thought despite watching television and got bored. I was quite literally doing nothing, and I decided to simply do what I knew I should be doing.  


All of my negative thoughts, feelings and internalized world views would either change to something worse, or amplify. I would worry, feel shame, sadness or anger at the smallest things. For example, taking a hit of my cannabis vape pen whenever I experienced something slightly negative in a video game. Right now I've been having a lot of outward shows of anger in private due to minor things, like making small spelling mistakes while writing, and it manifests as pressing hard on the keys. I felt like I had no one to love or even care about me, and despite my own internal deception, I know it's untrue.

I have done basic breathwork and calming exercises for years, but only very recently started to explore a more serious meditation practice.

In the past week or so I feel my overall mindfulness has increased a ton. More and more I feel just very mentally quiet, without my usual racing thoughts, not thinking about past or future or even thinking about very much, honestly. I'm able to focus on what I'm doing and how my body feels. I am very aware of my heartbeat and my muscles. Basically I am much less distracted by what's going on in my head, and more attentive to what's happening in physical reality.

Since I started experiencing this 'quiet' I've had a few moments of inexplicable bliss. I experienced it while listening to a song I really like, and again while I was driving when I noticed how the sunlight looked on the trees. It's very intense. It feels like if I had been trapped in a dungeon cell for ages, then finally got out and saw the real world. When listening to the song I actually had to stop what I was doing and close my eyes because it was so strong.

It's definitely interesting, but a little overpowering, and led me to the question in the title.

Meeting ID: 821 2107 2883
Passcode: 7CeNTi
**Note: Meditation will promptly begin at 12:05pm Pacific Time. Waiting room will open at 12:00pm Pacific Time. Please be on time. I will not admit participants after 12:05pm to avoid distracting others**

## Why?  
* Meditation is a transformative practice. But, developing a meditation practice can be hard.  
* When I first started, I struggled to establish a habit.  
* Having a community of others to meditate with can be really helpful in establishing a habit  

## What?  
* A quick 10 min meditation.  
* Feel free to BYOM - bring your own meditation style.  
* I will provide quick instructions for beginners  
* This is not about the type of meditation  
* Rather, it is about providing a space for meditation.  

## Structure and Timeline  
11:50am: Waiting room open  
12:05pm: Meditation begins  
12:05-12:10pm: Comfortable posture, set intention, quick instructions for beginners  
12:10-12:20pm: Meditate  
12:20pm: Session close. I will hang around for 10m if you want to chat  
*All times are in Pacific Time Zone*

## About me  
* I have spent 1.5+ hours meditating every day for the last 12 years  
* Many different styles including Vipassana, Vedanta, Kriya yoga  
* Meditation has truly transformed my life giving me greater clarity and making every moment more beautiful  
* This is a small effort on my part to give back to my teachers and the community",False,"Let's Meditate Together (LUMT) - Apr 17, 12pm Pacific Time",0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1c6fmam/lets_meditate_together_lumt_apr_17_12pm_pacific/

The thing is that when I used to meditate, or think about deep and meaningful thoughts, I have a feeling of tickling/tingle exactly in the crest of my egg shaped head. It doesn't feel bad, it feels amazing, it feels fresh and like electricity, I find very hard to describe it with words.

I have talked about this with other people, but seems like nobody felt anybody like this ever, but for me is very habitual, I just have to think about things that I find transcendental or meditate.

I want to be clear that I am not any expert in meditation, I just meditate like for a year when I was 21, and since then many years have passed and I have never meditate again like I used to do, but sometimes I find myself meditating unconsciously while I am in a plane or in the metro.

&#x200B;

There was another feeling that I felt, but only when explicitly meditating, and it was like a very strong energy in my skull that I conceived as a fluid that waved and swirled within my skull and I played by trying to control it's motion and try to calm the waters or make it spin very fast, although it was very difficult and I could only affect it's motion up to some extent.

Respecting this fluid in my head I never knew if it was a real manifestation of something within me or just my imagination (and I am more inclined to think that it was just my imagination). But for the tickling in my head that I mention, I know it is real and not imagination, I feel it physically and very strong and always under the same circumstances, initially I was a little bit worried thinking that maybe something was wrong with my brain, but it just feels good, and interesting and energetic, it doesn't feel like something bad for me and I feel happy and amused of feeling it every time I do, it's like a signal that I am thinking deep and closer to the universe than to myself.

After 30 minutes suddenly another random dream came up (not horror) and along with it within few seconds another came up and then it followed by 15-20 more dreams in minutes. All of these dreams were random and non scary. I was actually shocked and panicked for sometime. Next day I was very excited and shared it with my family. However strangely since then I am very reluctant to sit for meditation. I know If I sit i will surely continue for hours. But not sure why I am unable to sit and procrastinating since morning. My whole day has paased just by procrastination today.

To clarify one thing, I’m not particularly interested in mindfulness apps or anything like that as I don’t need help with motivation or encouragement to meditate. Rather I am interested in learning as much as I possibly can about different forms of meditation, different techniques, different applications and different effects.

Sometimes it's intense.

I have a few questions : 

1.) I observed my intrest in things I like, has radically reduced ( I used to like Reading and Gaming) - I have no interest to do anything like that. Is this normal? I want a more balanced approach to life. Should I reduce  the amount of time I am medidating. 

2.) The point between the eyebrows has been vibrating like crazy. Sometimes I can feel the vibration in my throat as well. Along the jawline etc. 

Is this indicative of anything? Should I be doing / not doing anything? 


3.) I medidate a lot on my bed in shavasana. 
Is this recommended or should I just switch to sitting with straight spine? What's the difference.?

4.) I dream everyday. And by everyday I mean EVERYDAY- WTF is this about? I remeber them vaguely after I wake up and if I don't write them they vanish from my memory in a few minutes. Is this related?

. I have a CIA MKUltra remote viewing that I smuggled out of the program --- I have hidden the remote viewing and videos of my rediscovery of my identity very carefully in the YouTube database of videos more than a decade ago. The information in my archived video predates the public's limited exposure to the Gateway Program by over a decade and discusses in detail what cutting-edge quantum mechanics practitioners are only now declaring to be true, and much more that is beyond that, also disclosed in time-stamped video and hidden among YouTube data, which I will present in this correspondence. I will start at the beginning. MK ULTRA has been running since the late '50s. Dolores Cannon led a CIA team that used remote viewing to find children such as myself (indigos) under the cover of what she dubbed 'indigo children' for MK ULTRA's Gateway Program. I performed over 140 remote viewing sessions using the QHHT method that Dolores Cannon pioneered. My program ID was FILE NAME 'URIEL,' after the mythological Archangel Uriel, who was said to have the keenest vision of all the angelic beings. The following is the only remote viewing I managed to smuggle out, remote viewing session #113, \[https://youtu.be/jqv8TJT0Nbs\]. It was conducted using the QHHT method by the interviewer for Dolores Cannon's CIA research team. After Dolores Cannon's death, the program continued and still continues. This particular viewing speaks of the ongoing Orion wars and is descriptive of the conflict and home world description of one of the affected planets in the G J 2279 star solar system, my max range of viewing. The so far undetected planet will be discovered on March 18th, 2028, when its eccentric orbit will bring it to pass in front of a star (Giclas 99-49), and it will be detectable by every observatory on Earth. GJ 3379 (Giclas 99-49) is the nearest star in the Orion constellation, being around 17.5 light-years away from the Sun. The main sequence star is a red dwarf with the spectral class M3.5V. It has an apparent magnitude of 11.33 and an absolute magnitude of 12.68. The star is therefore not visible with the naked eye. It is located in the upper left part of the Orion constellation, below Betelgeuse. Its radial velocity is +30.0 kilometers per second. According to the SIMBAD database, the star is classified as a flare star. In the past, this star may have had a close encounter with the Solar System. Some 163,000 ± 3,000 years ago, it achieved a minimum distance of 4.30 ± 0.10 ly (1.32 ± 0.03 pc). I was discovered by Dolores Cannon at 12 years of age. I was born in 1968 at 4:44 pm. This date and time will be of importance later, as you will see. I was removed from my home and school at that time, my parents were informed that I had drowned in Conneaut, PA in Lake Erie, after being struck by a stone skipped upon the water by another child. My body was said to have been recovered 17 days later from Lake Erie, with the claim that the undertow took my unconscious body out from shore, for the excuse of my body being too bloated and disfigured by so long in the water, my parents believed I had died and because the state of my supposed body, I was given a closed casket funeral in 1980. I had grown up inside the program's confines, housed in a section of a secret bunker constructed beginning in 1958 and finished in 1961 called ""Project Greek Island,"" from May 4th on my 12th birthday in the year 1980. I was moved to Los Alamos research center to be housed with the other indigos like me at age 24 in 1992, when the underground hidden complex was discovered by investigative journalists from The Washington Post. They covered the existence of the complex under the false story that it was a bunker to house members of Congress in case of a nuclear attack. I can prove I was there because I carved the words ""Uriel was here, with the date I arrived there, May 4th, 1980"" into the cinder block in the second bathroom stall before the main dormitory after being assigned the chore of painting the lavatory, then painted over it in many coats of dark green paint until it was no longer visible. It is still there today and since the discovery of the bunker and publicly disclosed on May 31, 1992, by journalist Ted Gup. The actual purpose had nothing to do with Congress nor nuclear war; it was to protect the indigos from counter remote viewing by the Soviet Union. As it was falsely believed that remote viewing could not penetrate the Faraday cage mesh that enveloped the deep underground complex, after its public discovery, it has remained exactly as it was, thus my message is still carved deeply into the cinder block, simply removing the paint with a rag and turpentine will reveal it still intact. I was wiped, or so they thought, in 2011. False memories were implanted to make me believe I was a soldier named Jonathan Edward Miller, given VA disability at a rating of 100 percent for psychosis. The name's spelling is of importance, as I will explain later. The truth of remote viewing is that one does not see in the mind's eye places in this 3D dimension, rather it is viewing different dimensions that coincide with the one each person believes as the only one. Physicality is itself a falsehood, as I will explain in detail with more of the video footage I have Hidden in YouTube's data, this is the quantum mechanics just discovered truth, proven this year, dated more than a decade ago, understanding the universe's shape and form https://youtu.be/9gefrzmwyys. Life is not what it appears, not even remotely close to the reality that is existence. In actuality, it is this: https://youtu.be/\_JEdMvYr9NU. This information will be discovered in the next 10 to 20 years. As I have stated, I was wiped; however, due to multiple timelines, they could not simply kill me, though they tried repeatedly. In one timeline, for instance, a SWAT team entered my home and killed me, but death itself is an illusion; there is no such thing as death, only the collective belief that people live and die. They never fully understood how we managed to manipulate the dimensional spacetime that is reality, why they were in error about Faraday cages and deep bunkers protecting or shielding MK Ultra's gateway mission. They at the time, and for the most part until this year, believed reality was 3-dimensional, but in fact, it is 12-dimensional. end part 1.

Part 4 {{ Conclusion.}} After the successful assassination on May 2nd, 2023, I was given a choice by what some would call God to ascend to what most would consider Heaven or continue to try to jump again and remain on 3D Earth. Apr 17, 2008 , {MY CHOICE} https://youtu.be/Mf4\_KnVqeJ4 My final jump after 4 years, 4 months, and 4 days in a wheelchair. Born on 5/4/1968 at 4:44 PM. This past year, at 4:44 PM on 5/4/2023, I had completed living 54 years of life. At that moment, the sun turned blue for approximately 4 minutes and 44 seconds. I caught this moment in a photo. The following day, 5/5/2023, marked the first day of my 55th year. At 5:55 PM, a solar eclipse began. Since then, I have not needed a wheelchair and have been able to walk, albeit with a limp. In the realm of numerology, these occurrences hold profound significance. The repetition of numbers, such as 4:44 and 5:55, is often seen as a sign of alignment and synchronicity. These patterns are believed to offer a connection to the universe's energies, providing insight and guidance. In my journey, these repeated numbers at significant life moments seem to echo a deeper universal harmony. The Lakota Indian culture, with its rich spiritual traditions, offers a unique perspective on these natural phenomena. The Lakota people have a profound connection with Unči Maka, or Mother Earth (Gaia), and Wi, the Sun. They see these entities not just as physical bodies, but as sacred, living beings that offer guidance and wisdom. The sun, especially, is revered as a source of life and energy. Its unusual behavior, like turning blue, could be interpreted as a powerful message or a sign from the natural world. The Lakota's deep respect for nature and their belief in the interconnectedness of all life forms align with the principles of numerology, where numbers and natural occurrences intertwine to guide and inform our lives. The alignment of these significant dates and times in my life with the Lakota beliefs reinforces a sense of being in harmony with the natural world and the greater cosmos. {{{ blue sun birthday https://youtu.be/ge0xiUaKSVE }}} Side note – the banged-up version of me was pretty much my norm, every day for 4 years I tried to stand and walk, and every day I fell sometimes causing significant battery upon my body, but I never gave up. Title: ""Embracing Oneness with Gaia: A Journey Through Sun, Sweat, and Spirit"" Beloved Children of the Earth, Today, we gather under the embrace of Tunkasila, the Grandfather Sky, and Unči Maka, our Mother Earth, to rediscover our connection with the sacred circle of life. Our path is one of harmony, where the heartbeat of the drum echoes the heartbeat of the earth, guiding us back to our roots, back to the oneness with Gaia. In the light of Hanwi, the Moon, and Wi, the Sun, we find ancient wisdom. The practice of sun gazing, a sacred ritual of our ancestors, allows us to draw in the energy of Wi. Just as the sun gives life to the earth, so does it nourish our spirits, reminding us of the eternal dance between light and life. As we gaze upon the morning sun, let our hearts be filled with gratitude, our minds with clarity, and our spirits with the warmth of understanding and connection. Within the womb of the Kieva, the sweat lodge, we embrace the cleansing power of Ina Maka, our Earth Mother. The rocks, heated by the fire's breath, speak the language of transformation. As we sit in this sacred space, enveloped in the arms of steam and prayer, we shed our fears, our doubts, and emerge reborn, purified in body and spirit. The Kieva is our teacher, showing us that through endurance, we find renewal; through darkness, we discover light. And in the sacred ceremony with the peyote, the Medicine, we walk a path of deep spiritual insight. This holy plant, a gift from Wakan Tanka, the Great Mystery, is not merely a substance, but a key to the doors of perception, a guide to the realms of higher understanding. As we partake in this sacred rite, let us do so with reverence, with an open heart, ready to receive the visions and lessons that await us. Remember, we are all relatives in this great circle of life, connected to each other, to the earth, to the sky, and to all living things. May our journey today bring us closer to the heartbeat of the earth, to the wisdom of the stars, and to the deep well of understanding within each of us. Mitákuye Oyás’iŋ – We are all related.

Hello,
I don't know if its the right subtype to post this, but I try to be closer to buddhism and meditate in my everyday life.

Nonetheless I'm a very anxious person with ocd.

At the moment I'm having really bad problems with insomnia and it's extending to totally unreasonable stuff, always related to one of my roommates.

I'm always scared my roomate is judging me for my lifestyle (even if it is quite normal, but in the morning I often snooze my alarm) but I think it's mostly the fact she hears a lot of what I do and it feels suffocating even if she did nothing wrong. We share a bathroom on the same floor and the doors are quite noisy.

I'm also scared to disturb her, for example scared my alarm in the morning might annoy/wake her up if I don't turn it off right away/snooze.
I also feel bad if I go to the bathroom several times if I can't sleep because I know she hears me, even if she already told me that I'm quiet, I'm now afraid to not be quite enough.

I think I'm hyperaware of everything I do and with her presence, I feel it much more and I'm always scared to be annoying to her with noises.
I dont know why this gives me so much anxiety but it's like to the point I'm afraid to do yoga in my room because the vibrations might wake her or something.

I know she doesn't spy on me but she's very observant and already made comments about some stuff of my lifestyle (not mean at all).

I feel like I'm really becoming insane, it's like even when I'm in my room I feel the presence of this girl

I have this feeling my mind can't be at peace unless I'm living alone but it's a conception of my mind.
And I feel like when I read sacred texts it never corresponds exactly to what I'm feeling/living.

I hope its clear, and that you can give me some thoughts on that.

Thanks so much and peace on you all 🙏🙏

I suffer from pretty severe chronic costochondritis. The pain is something I can deal with, but the worst part is the feeling that someone is sitting on my chest, and only being able to inhale 50% of the way in before my chest just stops expanding. It's a very anxiety-inducing symptom and has led to countless panic attacks, with me gasping for air, etc. Not fun at all.

Now I'm not looking for any medical advice or suggestions as I always have healthcare practitioners working with me on improving the issue, but my PT and nearly everyone else has recommended daily meditation to improve my mindset toward my discomfort. The issue is that once I attempt to meditate, I quickly lose focus because of the breathlessness. I've tried guided meditations, and every time they say to take a deep breath or inhale deeply, I feel discouraged and annoyed at best, or panicked at worst.

I actually used to meditate frequently in the past, so it's not an issue of *how* to meditate, but rather how to navigate this particular symptom. Being a chronic condition, this has come and gone over the years (I'm currently 31 and it began in my mid teens after some nasty skateboarding accidents). This current flare-up has lasted for 4 months now, which is the longest and overall worst it's ever been. I'm starting to feel like I'm never going to improve and the negative thoughts are overwhelming me. I just need to find a way to meditate and calm my mind in spite of the breathing difficulties, but the whole issue is that focusing on the breath is the exact thing that's causing the mental anguish.

I'm sitting here now in a couch at home enjoying the sound of the clock ticking,
When i go outside i am enjoying the sound the wind makes when hitting the leaves of nearby trees... it really feels like I've reached some sort of calm/peace in my mind and it feels super good.

My main practice was the buddho method ( a mantra you repeat in your mind saying ""bud"" on the in breath and ""dho"" on the outbreath ).
I did this as much as my mind allowed me to throughout the day mainly whilst walking.
One of the biggest things I've learned to add to this practice was being gentle with my mind while practicing.

Not simply beliefs, but beliefs about ones self that refuse change and define who they are as a person.

  
Many people build their self-identity around arbitrary, fragile, subjective, or false beliefs. I am strong/weak. I am a doctor/janitor. I am superior/worthless. I am a man/woman. I am liberal/conservative. I am a Christian/Muslim. etc.

  
When these fragile beliefs are challenged, the negative emotional and physiological responses are strong.  Our brain's insular cortex interprets it as an attack similar to physical pain.  Our confidence and self-worth are degraded.  There's a cascade of instability that effects all other beliefs built on these foundations.

  
One of the core elements of most mental illness is self-identity. When you allow external ideas to define who you are, you're giving away all of your power. If you think you're undeserving, you won't be assertive. If you're untrusting, you won't form relationships. If you feel judged, you won't express emotion. If you have that intuitive idea that ""this isn't me!"" then you won't feel any control.

  
The political sphere is a prime example of this problem.  Identity politics is often used as leverage to claim assault based on the fact that challenging deeply held beliefs is violent through the aforementioned pain mechanism. There's often attempts to change everyone else instead of internal reframing. In our systems of modern tribal politics, you can't challenge the party if it is part of your identity. This is also means it can become impossible to use critical thinking or even consider any evidence against rhetoric.

  
This also goes for religiosity. Fundamentalists cannot reconcile the idea of inerrancy because it attacks them personally.  Differing religions often don't acknowledge that the wisdom and insight found in each have a large overlap.

  
False self-identity results in self-fulfilling prophecies. If you identify with a group that carries historical oppression, you will feel oppressed regardless of what happens. If you identify with a privileged group, you will feel entitled to what others have. Both of these have obvious consequences.

  
Suffering is mostly internal and self-inflicted. You are nearly immune to this if you build your identity on anti-fragile beliefs like having integrity, taking responsibility, trying your best, always learning, growing from every experience, being open-minded, and not giving up. These grow stronger when attacked and cause little to no suffering because they come with no expectations.

""No self"" is great if you want to practice asceticism, but householders still need healthy and productive foundations on which to build.  Both still need to raise the anchors holding them back.

Meditation is one of the most powerful ways to recognize, address, and rewire these limiting beliefs that we tie to our identity.

Sorry if my story is long.

If i power through the pain during meditation it starts to become something i don't look forward to. I can focus on sending good feelings toward areas that hurt by imagining them feeling better. It works to a point

 ( some may know better ways to do this or are just better at it then I but it's not a solution for me at this point )

So why not meditate lying down?

Because when i hit the breathless state ( heart rate slows and breath becomes very shallow ) 

breathless State is part of the yoga meditation i do.

 i start to fall asleep and then i jerk back to being awake which is really unpleasant.

So why the nails question?

I have a Shakti mat which i like it helps me relax it gives you an endorphin rush, it's helping my back pain a lot etc. 

Shakti mat is like a mat covered with small plastic spikes, so like a less aggressive bed of nails.


So why not meditate on the Shakti mat, because my heart rate doesn't slow enough to get into the breathless state.

Which is the problem with all solutions to meditate lying down without falling asleep if i have to contract some muscles or experience some minor pain, my heart rate won't drop so far. 

So i have seen magicians lie on a bed of nails during various magic tricks.

So historically what did yogi’s use bed of nails For?

Did it have nothing to do with meditation, but was part of their overall spiritual yogic program.

Ohh and there is a great solution to pain during meditation issue, there just one problem $$$$

Sensory deprivation floats i have done but they cost too much. Not something you can do often 

If i managed to get a home sensory deprivation float system its not just the initial cost, it's that you have an ongoing cost of thousands of dollars of Epsom salt ( high magnesium count makes you float ) 

No matter how much water filtration UV light you use to sterilize water you have to change the water a few times a year. And it's 1,000 dollars in Epsom salt everytime you do this.

Hope i wasn't too all over the place with my post, best wishes everyone.

It’s odd because I don’t think my eyes are rolling back much, if at all. I even opened my eyes during this sensation a couple of times and I found my gaze was down and the pain in my forehead persisted.

I do my best to treat things like this with equanimity, and stayed with it for several minutes last night, and I suspect if I could sit with this pain without thinking my eyes are going to explode 🤯 😂

After that i started to tap into what i was feeling mentally like stress about academics, and my crush. When i was finished with that i started to let go of the stress that came with my academics.

Total noob here. I've started mediating consistently over the last few weeks.

I sit in silence and focus on my body/breathing, I let thoughts occur and then I bring my attention back to my body, all good stuff.

Pretty quickly my body starts to feel tingly/pins-and-needlesy and I start to slip into this absolutely wild dream-like state. The thoughts that occur start getting profound and then the dreaminess of it all keeps scaling up until I'm having wild dreams and also physical sensations. One recent sensation was that of my body being this absolutely enormous cavernous entity, the dreamy thoughts are fast paced and very loosely associated, accelerating through hundreds of crazy things.

It's an absolutely extraordinary experience. The only thing I can compare it to are psychedelics or the kind of hallucinations you get from a really bad fever.

When that happens I usually get caught between indulging myself in this fun trippy thinking and another part of me which thinks ""this is supposed to be meditation, I'm supposed to be focusing on my body and freeing my mind from thoughts"". When I try to bring my awareness back towards my body, often that state of mind slips away from me and then I find it hard to sustain meditation after that.

I have about 10 million questions, but I'll limit myself to these:

Is this what meditation is?
Have y'all been tripping balls this whole time and the rest of us just didn't know?
Should I be leaning into this trippy dream-like thinking or trying to maintain thoughtlessness?
Is this a recognised ""stage"", and/or are there well known stages?

Wild stuff. Anyway, I'm glad to be a new member of the community, good luck getting rid of me now.

* Feel free to BYOM - bring your own meditation style.  
* I will provide quick instructions for beginners  
* This is not about the type of meditation

I went through a massive spiritual shift. I realised that I had felt like the universe was against me my whole life. That I didn’t ‘know’ that I was loved. I felt the truth of the universe, of loving kindness energy, and that nothing could hurt me except myself.

I have suffered from severe depression and anxiety my entire life. This retreat completely changed my perspective on life, afterwards I truly felt as though things would turn around for me. And they did. I was doing great, was able to connect with people easily and I was able to exist with ease. 

I recently have gone through a break up and it’s destroyed me, somewhat. I really feel like I’ve fallen back into a depressive state that I haven’t felt since before my vipassana. 

In a few months time, I am looking at doing another vipassana course for 10 days, which will be more intense, 10 hours of meditation per day. (In the Goenka tradition)

Is it too soon to go back? I feel as if I should be able to get back on my feet after my initial vipassana and what I learnt there. But I feel like I’ve fallen off the tracks again mentally and don’t feel connected to myself anymore. 
I have this theory, that after another vipassana, I will just have to come back to my life again and deal with myself again. So that I need to learn how to integrate the light that I experienced into my daily life. 

Do you think I should go back and do another vipassana course?

My focus is less on me and more on the thought of doing meditation with the *right* method. And then I get lost in thoughts of whether or not there really is a *right* method.  
  
My approach to meditation is purely secular and of the books I've read - and with great respect to Thich Nhat Hanh, Sharon Salzberg, Pema Chödrön, Jack Kornfield, Bhante Gunaratana and Jon Kabat-Zinn - the books I've enjoyed the most, and have felt the greatest connection with, have been those that focused on neuroscience and the neuroplasticity of the brain. For me, the answer to the *Why Do I Meditate*? question is to lessen anxiety/rumination/OCD/worst case scenarios, to be calm, and to better recognize and accept the natural ‘goodness’ in myself and in others.  
  
My meditation is what I think is vipassana (please correct me if I’m wrong!). I sit in a chair with my hands in my lap or on my thighs. I close my eyes and take a few slow, deep, breaths, and then I let my breathing return to normal. I focus on the sensation of the breath at my nostrils and that’s it. In and out. When my mind wanders, I try and name the thought if I can (worried thought, anxious thought) and I reassure myself that I can return to the thought later, after I’ve finished meditating. Other thoughts (I need to go to the store, I need gas, what’s on TV tonight) I just try and dismiss as things I don’t need to think about now. I congratulate/thank myself for recognizing that I wandered, and I gently bring my focus back to my nostrils. If I have an itch or something like that, I recognize the itch and name it and feel it and then I scratch it and then return to the breath. If I’m distracted by a sound, I recognize and acknowledge the sound and then return to the breath. Sometimes I’ll count breaths to see how far I can get before my mind wanders (I’ve made it to 11 in pure awareness of my breath). That’s pretty much it. I set my timer for 20 minutes and I have three soft interval bells every five minutes.  
  
I can’t seem to get past the thought that what I’m doing isn’t good enough. Or that it’s not the right thing to do and that I shouldn’t be doing something else.  
  
I’m not sure what I hoped to gain by posting this and maybe I just wanted to put the thoughts down on paper and send them out there somewhere.

And although I had that as a habit and felt already good because of doing it, somehow I lost the habit of practicing meditations. 
I try to do it just a few minutes a day to get that habit but somehow I don't get it. 

How do you make meditations a habit and how do you not lose it?

I’ve always thought observing thoughts is a great way to manage anxiety thoughts. Noticing a thought in the mind, observing it, not analyzing it, but just accept it as a thought, and then return to the present. But recently I’ve been doing some research and heard from people that observing thoughts is not good, someone even said it can be dangerous in the long run and can make you go crazy if you don’t have a guided master that can help you. I guess this is because emotions that is attached to these thoughts “energy” can fuel these thoughts if you just observe them, and can lead you to going “crazy”. Instea, they claim to find the “source of the thoughts”. I’m new to mediating and this makes me pretty anxious cause whenever I observe my thoughts I feel like I’m doing everything wrong all of a sudden. 

How are one supposed to deal with anxiety thoughts rising? Someone said “ignore them” but that sounds like pushing them away to me. 

Please help me, because spiritual guides like Eckhart Tolle made me get into mediation and observing thoughts is a huge part of his education. 

Is this true, or can someone enlighten me on this thing :) I’m going nuts thinking it’s not good to observe my thoughts anymore, how do you even find the source of the thoughts, and why is that necessary when you can just observe, accept, smile to the thoughts, and let them run, and be present, while returning to your anchor point (breath in my case)

**Here is a little back story:** I've had OCD since I can remember. It didn't cause me any problems the first 25 years of my life. I've always had some minor intrusive thoughts followed by behaviors that I absolutely had to do every day before sleep or before shower. This didn't cause me a lot of trouble until the last 5 years when I started to invent more ""rules"" I had to follow, or something bad would happen. This progressed a lot and it took me half an hour extra to get to bed, couple of minutes to just get out of shower and on bad days I could barely read a book because I had some rules I had to follow. I couldn't close a window or a door without repeating some positive mantra. If that failed I had to close the door again and it would sometimes take 10+ tries.

**What I did:** I started to meditate only a month ago. First I read the book Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle and downloaded the app Waking Up by Sam Harris.

**What I realized:** I realized that instead of ignoring the intrusive thoughts, I observed them. It's hard to describe, but instead of trying to think of something else, ignoring them, or trying to do the behaviors to make things better, I observed the thoughts until they went away.  
For example, when I was at my worst, when I poured a cup of coffee I had to think about positive thoughts when I was making the coffee. If I started to think about negative thoughts I had to start again or else these negative thoughts would become real later on. It sometimes took me multiple tries (9 or more) to pour one cup of coffee!  
After I just started to pour coffee, and let the negative thoughts come and don't ignore them, and just observe them without judgement, they went away eventually.

For me this was a game changer! Not only for the OCD but also for everything else. When I feel stressed out, I just observe the emotions coming in without judgement, and after just couple of seconds they just go away. If they don't, I just think about it for a little bit longer and it goes away eventually. And then I can continue.

Another example: I couldn't step on lines or something bad would happen.  
Now, I just step on lines and when the intrusive thoughts come in, I don't ignore them, but I also don't think about them, I observe them, like a sound or another feeling. They might cause some stress at first, but they just pass by and become nothing. Like every sound that you hear.  
After a while this progress becomes automatic. Sometimes the intrusive thoughts are strong, but don't act on them immediately! Don't ignore them and don't judge them either. Observe them coming and after a little bit they just go away.

**What didn't work:** I've always thought that meditation was to focus on the breath and try to relax. That works to wind you down, but the moment I start to think about something stressful, I don't feel relaxed anymore and have to relax again.  
After reading the book and doing the daily lessons from the app for 2 weeks, it completely changed my life.

He wrote this:

“You get it backwards. Thoughts are not the cause but the action. You want to go to the source of your problem not what the mind comes up with as a result of it. It is known as peeling an onion for a good reason. You do not want to peel, you want to shrink the onion.

That is why so many people still do senseless thoughtwatching after doing it for 20 years and somehow think they do something beneficial when only one dismissal of their practice keep them all riled up for weeks and months.

True meditational practice is not watching thoughts or breathes it is focusing your attention inwards. When you watch thoughts you focus your attention behind the eyes and when you watch your breathe it is mostly breast and the belly but also (later on) includes the nasal region.

So simply go for exercises that move the focus of your attention thoughout your body and you will have a way better meditational experience.

The only exception like I said is if you are under the guidance of a true master like Mr Tolle or Singer or whoever you choose. In that case the presence of the master does all the heavy lifting for you.”

As I got deeper into the meditation it was a blacked out figure at the start meditating on a very vibrant green grass mound in the middle of still and blue water. There were smaller mounds next to it so the figure could walk if needed. The sun was shining behind them and rocks started skipping on the water. I could hear the rocks skip and it was so vivid. Just the most satisfying sound. It was so real and THEN  it shifted from 3rd person to 1st and I became the figure for a brief period of time. 

I ended up doing a rough sketch of this scene and realized that a better version must exist so I can remind myself of this truly beautiful and peaceful place.

So far I've used it to deal casually with stress and anxiety which has worked wonders, but I haven't gone much beyond that until recently, which has brought up this question.
I have a lot of racing thoughts, and I use 2 methods in dealing with them.

1 is I acknowledge the thought, say 'okay', and let it go. I usually picture my mind as having a front door and back door, and every thought is welcome to come in, but I leave the back door propped open and let the thoughts pass without examination.

2 is that I focus on the thought uncritically and see what I can learn for it. Sometimes I realize that a thought is untrue, or masking certain emotions, or it simply leads me to another thought which I never would have had if I hadn't stopped to examine the first.

2 has been the most helpful for me in confronting my fears, seeing truthfully, and facing my daily life with clearer eyes. 1 however has led me to some interesting states that I can't really describe, where I felt simultaneously very aware of my body and yet very separate from it. I also felt very, very far away from my surroundings, not physically but in the sense that everything felt irrelevant including my thoughts and my body. This wasn't stressful or ecstatic. It felt kind of like I went mentally 'away' on a very distant trip which gave me a new perspective on things, and in that perspective none of it mattered very much. Which is maybe overstating things. It wasn't extremely intense or dramatic, it was just interesting.

Is one or the other method more correct? 2 feels like it might be too much ruminating on the wrong things, however I wonder if 1 is just me putting my brain/body in an odd state that doesn't have anything to do with meditative progress, and if it might also be a form of evasion in not dealing with reality.",False,"Thought arising, examine or dismiss it?",0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1c238rx/thought_arising_examine_or_dismiss_it/

It’s so well written and easy to understand.

Today I meditated for the first time for ten minutes and it went pretty well. I just followed the book and focused on my breathe using counting to regain focus whenever I got distracted. I could definitely feel my breath getting longer and my body became very calm.

The only thing that I am still confused about is the “sign” that is mentioned in the book. Here is the quote:

“As you keep your mind focused on the rims of your nostrils, you will be able to notice the sign of the development of meditation. You will feel the pleasant sensation of a sign. Different meditators experience this differently. It will be like a star, or a round gem, or a round pearl, or a cotton seed, or a peg made of heartwood, or a long string, or a wreath of flowers, or a puff of smoke, or a cobweb, or a film of cloud, or a lotus flower, or the disc of the moon, or the disc of the sun.
Earlier in your practice you had inhaling and exhaling as objects of meditation. Now you have the sign as “the third object of meditation. When you focus your mind on this third object, your mind reaches a stage of concentration sufficient for your practice of insight meditation. This sign is strongly present at the rims of the nostrils. Master it and gain full control of it so that whenever you want, it should be available. Unite the mind with this sign that is available in the present moment and let the mind flow with every succeeding moment. As you pay bare attention to it, you will see that the sign itself is changing every moment. Keep your mind with the changing moments. Also, notice that your mind can be concentrated only on  the present moment. This unity of the mind with the present moment is called momentary concentration” (Beyond Mindfulness in Plain English).

Can anyone explain more about what this sign is?

Lemme tell some incidents 

1 

I live in Haryana, India. A few years ago we met a saint, named Saandanath, aka Sanda baba. Bro lived in a small hut like building with two of his disciples.
Went to him with my uncle and a family friend. The dude was there to share his problem to Sandanath. He touched baba's feet and sat there silent. 
Baba asked what he wants..
He stayed silent.
Baba smiled and said ""your girl(daughter) ran away?""
Bro nodded yes.
Baba said ""she'll be there at your door this Saturday, with policemen"" 

Shit was weird. And what's more suprising is that the girl who ran away from her home with her lover (yup we live in a conservative society, parents don't allow to choose your partner), she came home to meet her father with policemen for protection. that too on Saturday.
That incident stuck in my brain because how tf can someone predict something so accurate. 

2 

Me and my mother went to a Hanuman temple in Rajasthan with my uncle and aunt. This was our first visit to that temple. My uncle has went there many times. We met this woman who was a female monk. She talked with my mom. My mother told her about how things are not going well lately. That woman told her about my cousin's death and someone putting tantric things in our backyard. Mother got surprised. But I just thought she's a scammer mentalist who can read mind and she'll ask for money after that. But after that my mother asked her if she will ever find some lost documents (was about thousands of rupees, and was lost for a year). She stayed silent. then said ""Thursday"". Also told mother to do pooja of lord Hanuman(Monkey God in Ramayan) for 21 days. 
Guess what happened on that week's Thursday??? Nothing.
We even forgot about that conversation. But that's not all. The very next Thursday we got a phone call of my sister's school teacher telling she found some papers. That's where the documents were lost. 

Since that day I believed that meditation and sadhna can make you see future. So it's only about seeing things in different stages of time. 

3 

The third incident was also with the same baba Sandanath. He lived near the village of my mom's side family. The neighbour to our house in Village had problems with some government official and a court case. Baba told him your door will be knocked this saatam(saptami, don't wanna explain, it's just a date in Indian calendar). Bro got his work done with lawyers that day at his home. Now next day i also went there with him. He said thanks to baba. Baba told him things would have worked out early if he didn't wait for hours to open his mouth. 

So it was more than just seeing future, here's something about manipulating future incidents. At this point i was scared to even ask anything to that mystic being. There are many things that I'm not proud of. I was never comfortable about my past. I stopped going there. 

.

And there are couple more such people I've met in life. Some sadhus, monks and tantriks. One of the tantrik dudes was a relative.

and here's why i posted it in this sub. The common thing about them is Dhyaan, meditation. They all meditated to God. 
And what's even more similar is that all these people lived a non-luxurious life, unlike those rich preachers we see on television. 
they ate very simple food. Wore very simple clothes. Lived like they don't have much desire in materialistic things. 

Sandanath was the weirdest one. He smoked weed and consumed opium. He did tapasya. He stood on one leg for years to a point worms started eating the flesh of his foot.
Tapasya is a kind of meditation where you go through extreme circumstances physically and mentally challenging your body and keeping focus. Many Sadhus do different tapasya, you can see Sadhus doing tapasya sitting between piles of fire in heating temperature (we call it dhoona tapna) at Baba Tuta Ashram, it was the same place where Saandanath did tapasya.
Saandanath left his body last year. He left his body consciously. Like a timer count.
He has a samadhi there now. 

Baba Tuta Ashram/temple is the place where a famous saint Baba Tuta took samdhi(left his body). He also did hard tapasya and deep meditation. It's in Dubaldhan Village. Many Sadhus live there and do tapasya today. 

Now again, the WEIRD thing about this place. 

There's a feast that is arranged every year, in Dubaldhan village. In this Bhandaara(feast) thousands of people come from different parts of state. and the most expected thing is that it will rain on that day, doesn't matter if the sky is all sunny, doesn't matter if the sky is clear, doesn't matter if monsoon hasn't come yet. Everytime when the serving for this feast starts, there will be dark clouds within an hour to rain over that place, even if there's a full year drought. The feast will be arranged again this year June you can come over and eat, and meet sadhus and Naths. 

All what I'm saying here is that there is something unknown to us. There's is something about meditation which is beyond human knowledge. I'm very confused and curious about what's out there in the world that makes these spiritual beings become so different from us.

- when I will turn my focus of awareness on example to breath or sensations I don’t understand if I will focus on these sensations and put my attention on them, or what other people say “just let go” and “watch” these things. But that’s not possible for me because if I don’t REALLY concentrate on sensations and my breath, my minds just starts to wander off. So how do I do it?

- when I thought arises I don’t know where to “let it be” and return to breath because when I return to my breath the thoughts just keep rising up over and over and over, and if I just “let them be” I will get involved in them again. 

So how do I actually focus on my awareness and practice it? Do you force your focus on breath and sensations, or just watch it? And if you say watch it, HOW? How do you watch your thoughts without wander of in thoughts? And then when thoughts arises, how do you just watch them without fully engaging in them?

My problem is when I meditate I feel like I have to do it right, because I try to grasp an idea with “thoughts” on how to meditate, which leads to more anxiety and confusion.

“Wait I have to let go and just watch”, “wait now I just thought of watching my thoughts which is another thought”

For the last 3 weeks its been 15 mins 2x every day. I am using the breathing method outlined in both Tich Nhat Hahn's teachings and the Mind Illuminated by Culadasa. My main problem is I pretty much exclusively live in my head (probably to do with my ASD). Everything I think is some internal narration, to the degree that even putting methods into practice becomes a task of my inner voice 'realising' what ive been doing wrong and concluding on the new path. This is sort of what my head sounds like when meditating:

""I shouldn't focus in on every breath and hold onto it until the next breath, I should just experience it as it comes.""   
""Ah yep thats it!""  
Split second of silence...  
""Oh but I just broke my silence by thinking of how I should be thinking...""  
""Oops that was it again!""

Imagine this layered 50 times a minute. I seem to be stuck in this cycle of not being able to find some consistent place of rest, my mind needs to constantly be evaluating and working with the meditation. I imagine some of you will reply ""just let the mind do its thing and observe"" but I genuinely don't think I can?

I called to mind various metaphors for these unwelcome thoughts that I've come across:

* Anger is like a poisoned barb with a honeyed tip.
* This resentful thought is a baited fish hook, I do not have to bite.
* This anxious thought is a whirlpool in a river, I steer my boat to one side.

The ""thought feed"" is not a feed one can unsubscribe from, but I can choose not to play the video, not to follow the link, not to read the comments.

  
Extending the metaphor, I can over time train my brain's ""recommender engine"" through what I engage with.  Engage with the ragebait thought, and it will recommend more of the same.  Engage present-moment awareness or loving-kindness thought, and that will be recommended more often.

We can put our awareness on the breath and feel the sensation of breathing in and out. Continuously returning back to the breath every time we get lost in thought. Eventually, we lose ourselves in this concentration and the breath becomes our whole world.  
So what exactly is the purpose of meditation? Meditation calms our mind and allows us to see thoughts and feelings more clearly. We begin to notice a change in our daily lives, thoughts and feelings we didn't notice before, are now in our awareness. We also begin to realize that before we were stuck in a tiring whirlwind of reaction. Reacting to every judgment, feeling and idea. Now, seeing this clearly we begin to balance what's reactive. There is less suffering in our lives. As we continue to balance the reactive, we also begin to notice that everything is impermanent. Every small sensation is impermanent and we know this inside and out. We begin to let go.  
So meditation simply calms the mind and prepares it for contemplation. Some people want miracles, they want explosions to happen. This is not right.

It took me a long time and lots of adjustments to actually see results and be able to apply what I learned on a constant basis in my daily life, but it's one of the things I'm more grateful about - not being a passive recipient or active fighter against my mind (not nearly as much as before, at least), it's an incredible blessing. Achieved through a lot of effort.

In the past few months tho, I've noticed that I have entered a different phase. I guess it's because it got more natural to me to not fight emotions and letting them go. Which I can't tell you how ""relaxing"" it is, not feeling like I'm constantly fighting with my mind, trying to keep it at bay or waiting for something negative to happen.

I still have many things to work on, to improve and look forward to it. But yeah, it's lovely to be able to see that progress.

On the other hand, I've noticed that I'm also letting pass and go of most positive emotions I feel. I'm not numb, but it's a weird sensation. If previously I would get excited for meeting a certain person, having a certain experience... in way that permeated me fully, that for example brought me an 8/10 level of excitement, happiness and lasted for minutes or hours - now I hardly reach more than a 5/10 and the sensation quickly fades away.

It's not bad per se, I don't feel bad or incapable of experiencing those sensations. It's just that I feel like most is passing through me and I'm not fully grasping anything. Which, again: it's a blessing as I'm not holding onto negative emotions that made me spiral in the past and that built up in time. But at the same time it makes me feel there, but not really there if I'm watching a sunset.

It probably gives a more balanced outlook, a steadier pace going forward. I can't help but missing the depth of emotions I used to feel.

&#x200B;

I had a nice conversation with a friend recently that got me interested in meditation, and it got me wondering if it could be beneficial for me. Therefore, I can't wait to learn more, so I subscribed to this Subreddit right away!

&#x200B;

My situation is that I need to have a podcast on in order to fall into sleep. If I don't do that, I will get all these rumination/overthinking thoughts:

\- Remember that weird/awkward thing you said in class 4 years ago?

\- You should have chosen another degree

\- Maybe you should go live in another city

\- You should spend more quality time with your family

&#x200B;

These thought are not that negative, as you can see, but they just keep on shooting through my brain the minute I dim the lights and try to fall asleep. And I really mean that they are around for 10-20 seconds each and then the next one pops up. Often about something I have not thought about in 8 years! So then I always fire up a podcast and just fall asleep while listening to it. 

I have already tried limiting my music and podcast listening during shopping/running/commuting to work, but then these rumination/overthinking thoughts never seem to pop up. Therefore, I think that meditation that works in two ways might be helpful:

1. Meditate **during** the day to purposefully bring up rumination thoughts such that those moments where these thoughts race through my brain have a chance to occur during daytime, and it will (hopefully) be less active when I try to go to sleep
2. Meditate **when** trying to fall asleep to prevent rumination from happening.

&#x200B;

What do you guys think? Which meditation techniques would you recommend? I wonder if you guys know some specific technique names that I could apply and investigate more.

I tend to think that I’m extremely unselfish, but I think this might just be what my ego wants me to think. Like my ego says I’m unselfish so I’m good, but at time when it really comes down to it I think of myself before others and what sort of things suit me. 

I wanted to post this to get it off my chest and develop a more unselfish lifestyle for the good of those around me. I also think that selfishness actually leads to unhappiness, but then isn’t a want to be happy also egocentric?

How can we ultimately be not self serving?

Thank you everyone for your responses. After reading everything and reflecting I think what I feel is selfish is ultimately if I think I put my needs on a level of importance more than others. While we all have our own needs I think maybe this is the exact thing to recognize. Since we all have needs, all of our needs are equal in importance.

So I have beeb going through a tough breakup where my ex decided to leave me for reasons such as ""I need to work on myself"", ""I dont feel like i can give you what you need"", etc. We left on good terms, after a nice discussion, saying she felt like we will have more stories together and that i had all she ever wanted in a bf... yeah, well 2 weeks after she's already dating someone else. Found out when i bumped into them in a club. You could imagine the shock. Now where am I going with this? Well, since the initial breakup, I really started to put in the work on myself. Changed jobs, started to take care of my mental and physical health better. I was trying to understand my past traumas. I was seeing progress and I liked it. But, this past weekend, I went to another rave/party for a friends BD and bumped into my ex once again. It fkg ruined my night.

Took 2 mdma, alcool and some other stuff, trying to enjoy myself the best i can, but always kept bumping into them, i dont think she saw me, but he did. Anyway, my friend drove me home and on the way there I told him, ""I dont know how to process what just happenned"". 

I arrived home, I wasnt ""high"" but i still hadnt came down al the way, but the effects werent perceptibles. One thing was sure, I couldnt sleep. It was 8am and the sun was shining, decided to smoke some weed and sit down and just write as much as I could. I really forced myself to write more and more. An hour later, came back inside, sat down on the couch, trying to heat myself up and played a video on ""how to stop beating yourself up"". 

The main point at the begining was that some people have an inner voice that tyrannize your present self, constantly remembering them how useless and weak they were and how those voices came to be. And at that point, something clicked in me and tears just started running down my face. Not like little droplets, like actual rivers, non-stop. In that moment, i felt like I was reconnecting with my inner child, my past traumas and all my memories and anxiousness came to one point, like i finally understood why I act the way I am today. I understood everything about myself, how I act, react and why. Everything made sense. The tears kept flowing and was crying as hard as I ever did, hugging myself like I was hugging my inner child, reassuring him that everything was going to be okay and he had to let go. I was conscious about what was happening and although it was painful and hard, I knew that I needed to keep going for something to happen, I had to go through the pain to see what's on the other side of that pain, because I might not be able to regain access to that state. So I did. I kept acknowledging to my inner child that he was in good hands, he needed to trust me and that I loved him, no matter what happenned before, he needed to trust me. 

It lasted about 5 minutes, but it felt like way longer than that. I was panting, felt so much lighter, warmer, full of love, no more anxiousness, no more anger towards myself or my ex, I was in peace. I has been 2 days now and i still feel the same way, calm, awake and even more determined to live life.

I have no clue what I experienced. I've tought about a ""bad trip"". Yes the experience was violent, but the outcome was not. Though about ego death, but i'm not convinced... I was wondering if someone could shed some light unto this experience so that i can research it more and continue my healing process.",False,"An experience like no other, what's it called?",0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1c0bk16/an_experience_like_no_other_whats_it_called/

I've taken mushrooms many times now, and the feeling that always starts my trip is the feeling of my head floating away from my body or detaching and just floating alone wherever I'm hiking, while I was breathing I started to get that same sensation almost, like my head was no longer part of a body and was floating away, it was very nice and calming and very relaxing. Unrelated but one time I was having a bad trip on mushrooms, lights and sounds were making my brain freak out is the best way I can describe it, so I laid down in bed with no lights and thought of water and next thing i know I swear i was flying over water, I could feel the moisture on my face and the air was wet, after a few minutes I opened my eyes and felt amazing and my brain was no longer screaming at me.

But anyway, when I opened my eyes today i was looking up at the ceiling almost, when I started I was basically looking forwards. What was up with the floating feeling like a coming on mushroom trip and the feeling like my body was gone. I felt very relaxed and the best way to describe it would be open?

Yesterday I had my deepest meditation until date .I wrote this post today in the form of a ‘report’ in hopes it would provide me insight (writing it) but it's also very elaborate to possibly help others too! It was truly difficult to wriite out the experience in words but one day I want to finish writing a book on these topics, so this is great pratice!

TL;DR: I finally got to get a glimpse of true awareness /  nonduality / no-self 

Results: It’s been just day but it has left me feeling different and more calm, which I hope sticks and contributes to permanent improvement in my awareness and overall wellbeing.

So about this post:

* I gave it headers so you can easily read it or skip parts, despite it being a long-read! There are 10 parts of this story to make it easier to follow.
* Until point 3 = How I start my meditation. (You can skip this if you like / useful for beginners maybe)
* The meditation was about 1.5 hours long
* I'm meditating most of my life off an on, I'm 24 now and started praticing more consistently and seriously since January.
* \[INFO\] is information I had in my head already so it’s more intuition/knowing than entire thinking patterns that I create during the session.
* At the end of the session, I experienced the feeling of panic so I hope there are people who might have gone through this already and can give some advise
* (Some people PM me not to get stuck on 1 experience. No worries - I am not, I just love writing and I hope it's helpful! It's always a challenge articulating everything and English is my 2nd language.

I hope you enjoy & that you maybe find it helpful !

**1. Starting the meditation with the natural breath**

So yesterday, I started my meditation by taking a moment to focus on my breath. I realize that as I breathe, I take new and fresh energy in and as I exhale, energy goes out. At the first breaths in a session, I often experience some tension. I notice what I am feeling. Maybe it’s some stress or worry, or I’ve just had a long day. That’s okay. As I exhale, I commit to releasing any tension stress I may be carrying. I let go of fears and worries on my mind. As Iinhale, I breathe in the fresh energy that life has to offer. Soon I will notice just breathing becomes like a nice flowing pattern. Sometimes I purposefully experiment with pausing my breath momentarily after exhaling. Don't force it; simply observe as your body instinctively resumes breathing, smoothly and without effort This way, I become more aware of how the body takes over naturally.

**2. Slow bodyparts scanning & deminishing resistance**

So now I move my attention down through your body. You all might know this technique as a ‘body scan’. I feel every part of my body, my stomach, my upper legs, my knees. Itching in my toe for instance, musle ache in shoulder, etc. In some places it’s discomfort, some places are okay, some don’t feel anything. All of this is part of awareness; even ‘no sensation’ is. As I calmly go through this, with the breath naturally doing it’s thing, I can feel myself sink a little bit deeper into the meditation.

*\[INFO\] Sorry, I didn't write much on observing thoughts because it's becoming quite effortless for me. That it isn't mentioned much doesn't mean this wasn't part of my practice though! Of course I also have thoughts arising, and fading.* 

**3. Internal / External & INQUIRY: where is sound?**

So now so now what I did is being “aware of little pieces of awareness.” Essentially I am drip feeding my mind with what true awareness can be. I purposefully did that slowly and attentively, by really taking the time for it.

*\[INFO\] As a person who used to always want to do everything fast, and everything at once, this used to be really difficult. At the beginning I was very much like “Can we just skip this boring step?” But I understand now how my ego or ‘monkey mind’, naturally doesn’t want to let go of control. So much, that it can make you feel uncomfortable when it does sense it’s losing control. Therefore, by taking it slow, you give your monkey mind a smoother and easier progression into the meditation session, which results in much less resistance.*

So, after having passed by every part of my body, I turned my attention to the ambient sounds surrounding me. As I did so, I noticed how I always hear the sound coming from “somewhere” (c.q I experienced sound as “car” with “noise coming from outside on the road to the left of me” or “frigde” with “noise coming from my right, from the kitchen”, etc).

*\[INFO\] This is useful in daily life and for survival but in meditation that's not necessary, right? We're not meditating, to hear each sound and where it's coming from. Over the past months I had found myself wondering what it’s like to experience the world without all these intelligent human brain filters. They say that what’d be left, would be something way more honest, way more pure. Awareness.*

**4. Distance of Sound / Doing v.s Being**  
The next 20 minutes (estimation) the meditation unfolded organically, with my focus alternating between bodily sensations and external stimuli like sounds. Back and forth. Going from external, to internal, to external, to internal. At this moment, I was feeling real calm, and just generally enjoyed the session.

Slowly I started to understand that the way I was percieving sound could be seen as me performing an “activity”. This was my mind at work again - keeping control over the situation by trying to make sense of things. Any activity that I do is just distracting me from what's already there. Awareness is always in the background, they say.

As I went deeper into the meditation, right as I went internal / focussed on body parts, suddenly realized I’m still hearing the sounds. But now, what changes, is: because my attention is away from all those individual sounds, they became one sound.

The sound of the cars, the refrigerator, some wind, some birds chirping; It all just became one sound that I was hearing. It all had some sort of nice constant hum to it and this sound almost tickled my ears, you know? I could just feel how the vibrations reached my eardrums and translated through my brain into the sensation ‘sound’.

So, that’s new. There is absolutely no distance between me and those sounds. It became simply sound inside of my awareness.

And, at that moment, it's as though my awareness (and I was having my eyes closed) was becoming a bit more broader. As if I was in the center of something, and everything started opening up around me.

**5. Really comfortable spaciousness**

This was such a nice feeling. It's comfortable in a way, like, homecoming you know? You feel comfortable there. In that space. It’s like as if you're under your own warm, nice blankets on a winter day, and you just… You're just really comfortable.

**6. Where does the body end?**

So the body was at this point kind of fading away in the background of my awareness all together. I think it’s because I had already been past every feeling I could find in there (although relatively surface level) and this was enough to make me ‘feel as though I know it’. After the fact, I’d say I had lost quite an amount of awareness of the body, which might have been drowsiness (since it was night-time and I was slouching on the couch).

\[INFO\] *Early in the session, I had been mostly focusing on the small sensations in the body. So, I figured that, instead of focusing on individual parts of it, I should treat the body like how I treated the sound; .as one complete object.*

*That intention reminded me of something I read about people staring at objects in their room, taking it all in very consciously, to then question themselves “where the object ends”.  Where's the edges of this object that that distinguish this object from all the other things in the world? On a subatomic level, things look way different too, You know!*

**6. The veil dropped / Awareness**

So, I had this intention to do this now also with my body but I never actually got to go through this process of self inquiry.

Right when I wanted to go about questioning where “my body ends” and where “open air space would start”, it was like the veil just dropped. The illusion of separation just completely fell away.

This all progresses really, really fast, by itself. It was like a split-second pull into another space where “awareness of sensation of sound” + “awareness of sensations in the body” became simply “awareness.”

Random impulsive thoughts such as (“I should call X tomorrow!”) would naturally arise here and there even in the deeper states of this session. But this also just… stopped. There was no thought. I think there can not be, when there is no sense of I or no doing.

\[INFO' *There was no “Oh stomach ache”, “Oh leg cramp”, “Oh, car noise” anymore. There was no “I feel great!” or “This is awesome”. This was really something else and something I never experienced before (sober) and it’s been really difficult trying to write this out.*

I was already very comfortable throughout this meditation session, but after this rupture I started to become an ungodly amount of comfortable. You could imagine it to be a bit warm. Just comfy, comfy, and comfy peaceful. My breath was so slow and soft, I wouldn’t be able to feel it.. Almost no breath.

I can remember my vision forming bright colors. Bright baby blue, light white /violet, little bit of a warm orange washing over me… I was immerged in those colors and lights.

*\[INFO\] There were visual sensations throughout this entire session as well but I had not been paying much attention to them because from my experience, they’re mostly distracting. My mind would see them as entertainment or make me curious for ‘more visuals’.*

I was in this state for what seemed like an enternity. There’s absolutely no sensation of time nor nay way to ‘think about that’.

**7. Ringing / Panic / Control**

Then at some point, I felt myself getting pulled back to body sensations which surprised me in the moment as well. I started to hear ringing and this felt like an individual sound again. I had a thought, where I was like “Wow, that's an overwhelming loud noise!” you know?

Sudden overwhelming sensation of panic!

From here on it’s hard to explain and put into words and any input would be appreciated! :)

I don’t think the ringing was that loud actually, but it felt really loud compared to the state of nothingness I was in earlier. I felt this pulling sensation. As if I was gonna go upwards or something, or being pulled into something deeper (?) Everything's shaking. I didn’t really know what was up or down. I was feeling like my body again and it felt as though it was bobbing left and right a little bit, or forwards and backwards.

It was an interesting state of awareness I found myself in. I was observing the sensations I was having from a, what felt, very detached perspective now.

Suddenly I started feeling the sensation of my heartbeat coming up. It went faster and faster. I had this realisation of “I believe I am experiencing panic”.

*\[INFO\] I have to emphatise also that it was entirely new to me to experience an emotion from a perspective where I am not the one who is panicking but I do “experience panic”. If that makes sense?*

**8. No need to force it / change things**

At this piont I was back to the level where I am just “me, having the experience of me meditating”. The panic was a really intense and overwhelming feeling and I just didn’t know how to surrender to that, or what would be ‘the best thing to do here’.

I tried to place my awareness back on the body sensations, in an attempt to make the panic subside, to then later come back to it once it had calmed down a bit more. But I couldn’t manage to calm myself down, and not a single other sensation weighted up against what I was going through now. The sudden onset of panic and disorientation overruled my entire being. \[any advise is always welcome\].

Eitherway, I know ‘trying to fix it’ wasn’t going to lead anywhere so I surrendered to that and stopped the meditation here. There is no need to change anything!

**9. After this session**

Ater this session, I looked in the mirror and in my eyes I see a more clean picture of me. More real, more honest to the true nature of things. Today, a day after the meditation, I feel more attuned to my emotions and grounded in the present moment. I continue to carry a sense of tranquility and introspection more than I used to be capable of, so i am very curious where this road is going to take me through continuous and persistent practice.

Thanks for taking the time to read all of this and I truly hope you’ve either found this helpful, or have thoughts to share with me!

Have a joyful day!

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_My question to you\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

If anyone has input on the panic part of this report, I’d love to hear it!

**10. What I think about the panic after the fact:**

I think the panic came because I didn't know what was happening from the moment I got this deep into the session. I think it was because this unknown state was, unnerving to something within me and couldn’t stay in that state there longer?

I mean, captain hindsight rationalizes this and says: “I've just had this like one hour, one and a half hour sit where at least everything made sense. Sometimes I heard a sound that I couldn't place but all in all, everything made sense to me. And now it suddenly didn't. This, this was new.”

\[INFO\] I don’t think the ‘panic/disorentiation moment’ was a ‘negative’ thing.

I find that I enter a sleep like state pretty easily while also keeping a fair amount of awareness. Today I had a quite awesome experience of something akin to a lucid dream. As I began my meditation I slowly sunk deeper and deeper into the experience until my body slipped into a normal sleeping position without my conscious effort. 

 At first, the experience began as a normal dream, I remember dreaming about this building that seemed almost like an airport or something. The details are really fuzzy and confusing but this isn’t the main part of the experience. After the dream ended I realized I was still in bed meditating. This is where things began to get lucid. During my meditation my body began to move on it’s own. Like energy moving around. It felt very light and almost like I was really high on weed. I started walking around my room very clumsily and I tried my hardest to sink more into the energy to move. It was quite difficult though and I ended up being “reset” back to my sleeping position laying on the bed. Then my body would begin moving again. This cycle happened around 3 times maybe. During the experience I remember there was multiple times where I thought I was awake but was in fact still in deep meditation. It was super trippy. The sensation of being free spirit energy was the best part of the experience. I felt very in tune with my senses and surrendered. Which is something i’ve been striving for- going with the flow and surrender. Anyways, just wanted to share the cool experience. I wish everyone luck on their journey!

Long term lurker but first time poster. I learned meditation from a dear old grumpy mentor and practiced it intermittently. Sometimes life got in the way and I stopped and even with a recent vacation, I lost my consistency. 

I love meditation because of the clearheadedness stillness and at one point, I even achieved a split screen effect which was really cool. However I have never gotten it back, and even now, sometimes I wonder if I’m still doing meditation correctly. 

I follow focus of breath because it’s the easiest for me, almost like diverting my attention from something and returning my focus to the front of my nose. However, recently I noticed my focus of breath is off, meaning I can’t feel the sensation of breathing in/out as before. Probably because in the past I have breathing problems with my nose, I can always feel a small sharp pain when oxygen goes in/out of my nose that I can feel the slight pain which allows me to focus on breath. Now my breathing is clearer through my nose with no pain and I experience numbness in my hands during my sessions. I do 20x3 sessions per day. 

Can someone please explain to me why I experience numbness or why I cannot feel my breath as intensely as I used?

I felt my wife and kids who were Miles away.... I don't know how long I was in this state but when I opened my eyes..... the eclipse had passed and the sun was back..... maybe 6 mins 12 tops....

I try to focus on my breath and there is a constant background noise which doesn't bother me, nor do I feel that it steals my attention from my breath. But since it isn't in complete silence I'm wondering if I'm doing a mistake by meditating under the AC. 

2) I could also use the noise of the AC and focus my attention there instead of the breath of you think that would be better since the AC could distract me from the breath. What do you think? 

3) I'm someone who had quite some anxiety issues in the past and my mental activity is quite high so it tends to be pretty challenging for me to sit for a longer time. My sweet spot is around 15-20mins but sometimes like today I just do 10mins and get frustrated because I couldn't concentrate much longer. Any tips on that front?

Competition arises from feelings of unworthiness and is tied to hostility, Ill will, and a lot of greed. When you achieve or attain or win, you are still stuck in the mindset of ""not good enough, need to win"" and you don't get a chance to relax in life or be with other people in a genuine way.

There is tension and hostility. 

It's true that the guy who bullied you in school might be your boss one day, but it's also true that they're probably miserable inside. Competitiveness is like an addiction.

The term ""spiritual materialism"", coined by Chogyam Trungpa, means that people can take this same mindset into the world of spirituality without seeing the irony. ""Oh I'm more peaceful than so and so, he's more peaceful than me, I can sit on the cushion for 15 minutes longer than everyone"". They are totally missing the point. Probably it is a stage that most of us need to go through. Meditation is about being content with just being. It is about abiding in non-activity and feeling the raw sensations of being alive.

About a year ago, I became very interested in meditation and decided to give it a try one night. I sat on my bed, focusing on my breath and attempting to clear my mind. As I continued, my focus shifted to my chest. I became intensely aware of my breathing, feeling as though there was a hole in my chest that opened and closed with each breath.  
At a certain point, I started sensing the atmosphere around me differently. It was as if someone else was in the room, watching me. Despite this feeling, I remained deeply engrossed in meditation, even communicating, in a sense, with this presence, expressing my desire to continue meditating and refusing to open my eyes.

It started (as with many) via a psilocybin trip. I choose not to delve too deeply into that, however, suffice to say, I went to space, became one with the Universe, and felt more at peace than I had since I was a small child.  
  
Since then, I have been trying to get back to that space, mainly using yoga and meditation.  
  
**The pain comes before the thought**

  
One could say the pain is the thought. I managed to slow down my thoughts enough to gauge that when I have a physical pain, my mind then rationalizes this into a thought. For example, if I am sitting and I feel a tweak in my back, naturally my mind will convert this into whatever is troubling me most at that time. Tolle refers to this as the ""pain body"" and it's real. Additionally, I have created an unconscious feedback loop when deciding if I should pursue any task. For example, when I contemplate a certain task, my pain body decides if it's a good idea and my mind rationalizes why it's not or is. My mind is very good at coming up with convincing arguments either way.  
  
**I micro-manage every task**

  
If I go to make a cup of coffee, I will instruct my body - stand up, turn left, open door, get cup, and so on. I think this is something I have always had and is a protection mechanism. I have always been very clumsy, and the fear of other people seeing this and judging me has turned into this habit.  
  
After meditating regularly, I gain the ability to give broader instructions, ""go for a walk,"" and am able to watch myself almost like watching a movie. This state feels incredible, and I always amaze myself by performing actions I don't prompt. My favorite way of using this is during yoga, where I simply release control and watch what my body does. It always manages to find the source of my pain and work it out. Also, simply ""dance"" - I never knew I had such moves. A really odd side effect of this is my body seems to default to ballet positions if unprompted.  
  
**Progress is not linear**

  
After my ""dark night,"" I meditated daily and did 2 hours of yoga a day. I had some pretty sublime revelations. I kind of lost my mind a bit (on reflection) and started to preach to others about my findings. This did not go well. Talking to your friends in the pub about how everything is connected and we are all one is a fool's errand. Real life hit me like a ton of bricks, and my practice slowed, and the thoughts returned.

I just wanted to share how I feel, and hear your perspectives.

— It turned out a bit long, so I divided it into sub topics —

**My background:**

I've been meditating for 5-6 years but have maintained a regular practice for the last two (1-2 hours a day). Attended three 10-day Vipassana courses (going for a 4th to serve in May).

For about 6 months now or so, I've been feeling that my solo practice is no longer sufficient. I feel such a strong calling to connect with a teacher and receive guidance, and to practice in a sangha that sometimes it's hard to sit still, and it sometimes makes me cry when I meditate.

I've been learning from a Nepalese Rinpoche for some time, but then I was warned against him and out of fear of potential abuse (was planning to go to stay in his monastery in Nepal), I disengaged from him, and felt pretty lost practice-wise since.

**Search for the teacher and sangha:**

I tried reaching out to meditation centres in my country, in neighbouring countries (I'm from Europe) and in the States too, but either didn't get a response or they weren't able to accommodate me. I'm interested in Zen or Dzogchen (but pretty open to other paths if a teacher decides some is better for me than the other).

A bit of additional context: I have a boyfriend, we are in a LDR but working to get him a long-term visa to Europe. I also have a dog. For those two reasons, I don't feel like I could commit to a monastic life at this point, although it does pass my head from time to time. That also makes me feel a bit hesitant to continue committing to my relationship, even though I love my partner.

Rather, for now, I'd like to see if I can stay with a teacher somewhere for a month or a few. Ideally, I would still be able to work from my computer as I'm afraid to put my job at risk in the present market situation and with AI looming over us. I'd also prefer to go with my dog, even if that would mean staying outside of the centre but in close proximity and attending teachings and group practice. I know these are unusual, but I've seen some meditation centres accepting such circumstances, so I got an idea that perhaps it could be possible. But, of course, I am willing to consider any option.

**Aimlessness & the need for like-minded people**

The more I meditate, the more ""aimless"" I feel, in a sense that it is becoming increasingly difficult for me to find interest in most of the things people around me occupy themselves with (romantic relationships, buying apartments, growing families, clothes and gadgets, starting businesses, traveling, etc.). Those things used to be appealing to me, now, more often than not, as soon as I try engaging in them, I already see the emptiness of them, and so it feel pointless and like a waste of time and energy. I suppose it is just an outdated story of my mind, that's not yet adapted to the reality of my deeper mind. But still, the thing is, I don't know how else to be where I am now, with the people that surround me. I don't know where and how to find people who'd understand how I feel and with whom we could support each other in living in ways that are not commonly practiced in the society.

I think by now it's clear enough that I don't really know any people who have a similar practice and dilemmas, so I'd really hope to get some of your perspectives and advice. Thank you so much!

Recently I’ve found myself getting really worked up over the selfishness I’ve seen in others. I admit to myself that I build a great deal of resentment towards people that do selfish things, but I do not express it outwards towards them. Instead I hold onto it, similar to the “you drink poison hoping it will harm the person you resent” analogy.

This is really starting to hurt me mentally, my most recent example deals with someone in my group project who has constantly made promises to do work but in the end has done nothing with no acknowledgment, which means I have to continuously pick up their slack.

The hatred I feel towards this person is very consuming, I am having poor quality sleep and find myself ruminating more on social media to try and distract myself. I haven’t confronted them because I don’t want to be dramatic, but it really hurts me inside.

The imperfections of people in the world are so hard to accept sometimes, to me it almost feels like accepting flaws is a way of enabling others to hurt you. Even though, ironically, my lack of acceptance is what’s hurting me more. 

If anyone has advice or could reference something I can use to learn from this, I’d appreciate it!

Edit: I just want to say wow, thank you so much to each of you who took the time to write a thoughtful comment. I’ve gone through all of them and will save this post for future reference when these feeling resurface because you were all so helpful.

I had to make sure I wasn’t losing my mind so I checked my digital clock on my oven and it sure enough was blinking, which only happens when the power goes out and turns on, right.

Sorry just a side note. 

My main question is about the reasons you think (if you do) meditation should be practised by everyone. I’ve tried it and it hasn’t been too hard - I can turn off the voices p easily (except the occasional “how long has it been” “I’m doing pretty good”). I don’t have anxiety or depression or many negative emotions in general. I already have the intuition that the self is an illusion and don’t think we have free will and am pretty accepting of the way things are (it is what it is - and not making it any bigger).

Let's dive into a game-changing concept that can revolutionize your meditation practice and transform your daily life – Mindful Micro-Moments.

What are Mindful Micro-Moments, you ask? They're tiny pockets of awareness sprinkled throughout your day, where you intentionally bring your attention to the present moment with full awareness and non-judgmental acceptance. These mini-meditations may seem insignificant, but their cumulative impact can be profound.

Here's how to incorporate Mindful Micro-Moments into your daily routine:

Morning Mindfulness: Start your day with intention by taking a few moments to connect with your breath before getting out of bed. Notice the sensations of each inhale and exhale, setting a positive tone for the day ahead.

Sensory Savouring: Throughout the day, pause to fully engage your senses in the present moment. Take a moment to appreciate the warmth of sunlight on your skin, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, or the sound of birds chirping outside your window. Let these sensory experiences anchor you in the here and now.

Breath Breaks: When you feel stressed or overwhelmed, take a short breath break to center yourself. Close your eyes if possible and take a few deep breaths, feeling the air entering and leaving your body. This simple practice can help restore calm and clarity amidst the chaos.

Gratitude Reflection: Before bed, reflect on three things you're grateful for from the day. It could be something as small as a smile from a stranger or a moment of stillness in nature. Cultivating an attitude of gratitude can shift your perspective and cultivate inner contentment.

Mindful Movement: Infuse mindfulness into everyday activities like walking, eating, or even washing dishes. Pay attention to the sensations, movements, and rhythms of your body as you engage in these tasks, turning them into opportunities for presence and awareness.

By weaving Mindful Micro-Moments into the fabric of your day, you'll cultivate a deeper sense of mindfulness, resilience, and joy in every moment. Remember, true meditation isn't confined to a cushion or a specific time of day – it's a way of being that can permeate every aspect of your life.Elevate Your Meditation Practice with Mindful Micro-Moments!

I try to keep it short and maybe add extra info later.

My mum died at the end of this January. She had cancer since 2016 and it spread into her bones and liver in 2020. But it was controllable with hormonal therapy.

I didn't expect it to become so bad and serious. In November she went into hospital because she had an infection in her kidney. She had to stop the cancer therapy and later they had to get her back on track, but her body was also a bit weak for that. In the end she had one dosis of chemotherapy. Before she had a seizure; that's when they started thinking there might be cancer cells in her brain. After the chemotherapy she got a sepsis and had to go into ICU.
At the end of December the doctor told us they don't see a sense in giving her more therapy.

My problem now is that my mum was my rock, my best friend, always there with me. My parents are divorced and split when I was 2 and I spend my whole life with my mum. I don't have any siblings, my mum came from Poland to Germany for my dad.
So we had to be a strong team and we really have been.
My mum was a great person; very strong, with a great sense for the good and beautiful, extremely intelligent.

But lately we were fighting a lot. It was the plan that I move out now. I am 28 and my mum was 62. I started working in 2020 and my mum always said that I move out when I start working. Before that I was studying in the same city I come from so we said it doesn't make sense to rent two flats.
But in 2020 my mental health was horrible, I couldn't find into my job really and my mum got the diagnosis that the cancer spread three weeks after I started working full time for the first time of my life. It was horrible. 

After some time I finally found an apartment that was ""good enough"" - last May actually. But I never moved out.
We were just fighting more and more. I was always attacking her and unhappy amd felt so much pressure, because at work it was just not working out.

After some time I was sensing that the only thing that can help me and her is when I move out. Then I have finally my space and don't feel suffocating anymore. Because I didn't feel fully free at home. I felt, that my relationship with my mum is not on eye level and that I am not able to give her the attention of an adult and the love of the adult person that is in me.

Now my mum so suddenly is gone.

I feel guilt. I feel left alone. I feel stupid.
And I don't want to be the person that I am now. Because I'm nobody really.
I didn't become an adult with her.

I'm pretty sure that the ""mental health"" problems that I had where only the issue that I didn't make the step to emancipate from my mum and get into a more mature relationship with her.

If she would have seen me as the adult that I can be and the love and awareness that I have in me (also for her problems, that she was often hiding and not addressing. She first didn't want to tell me that she has cancer, she said it in a fight. And the first 4 years before the spreading she didn't go to doctors after the diagnosis, but wanted to treat it with a diet instead. She also had a complicated relationship with her parents and our family in Poland in general). I feel like with me becoming more aware and growing a lot our family dynamic could have changed. And my mum could have learned to love herself more again. She was quite strained alot in our life.

But I am so sure also that this growing was only possible with my mum. I need my mum. I am so angry that I had 4 years to create the situation that was necessary but I was just moody and running to my therapist. 

Now my mum is gone and I am empty on the inside. I can't even grieve her because I feel more like a child needing her mum back that an adult grieving her mum.

Now I ask you, if there is a way to go into that relationship even if one person is dead. It's not only that I would want forgiveness. I know that my mum forgives me everything. I also asked her for forgiveness in hospital and she said she couldn't imagine a better life than the one she had. But I also want to feel her love, support and pride. I want to give her something that I never gave her because we were too close.

Is it somehow understandable what I mean?
I feel like it is a lot to ask for and it seems like nothing I have ever experienced, but I have hope for me. I want to get into contact with my mum again, to be honest. Or to do some kind of internal work, that will have this outcome - feeling like I moved out when my mum was still alive and seeing her beeing proud and surprised that I can manage that on my own. But also giving her more respect and space, what she deserves so much.

I want more love in my heart. And I want it to be the love between my mum and me.

I want that stability and clarity that my mum had. And want to feel it in me.
I want openness and wisdom.
It all was so close.

But I can't even be sad.

I have the feeling that I was sensing that I might lose my mum. And my body was afraid of that pain and instead I was cutting the bond with these extreme fights. But at the same time keeping her ""spatially close"", because of course I knew that I want to be close to my mum and that I need her love.
And now I don't feel the pain but I also don't feel the love that was waiting for me behind that door of making a step away from my mum.

Saying bye to my mum and the idea of leaving was always a problem for me. So I guess it makes sense that it was hard for me now to move out. I was afraid to not be protected I guess.

I hope somebody can give me some advice. I feel like there has to be a way. My mum was there and her love was there and maybe it's still somewhere for me to unlock.

Best wishes.

But when I pull back and reduce my attention, things start running smoothly again. The problem is, I can't grow anything without putting in more effort and focus. I do meditate, but when I try to meditate more, the effectiveness seems to wear off. 

Because of this pattern, I've failed many times and feel stuck and helpless.

Its myopic and self centered. I've been manic before and during that state I experienced some incredible feats of mind and body. It gave me a sense of intuition and opened up many experiences I didn't think would come into my life. Those experiences helped me in ways I couldn't predict and my reality truly seems .. designed by intelligence.

Meditation has dispelled that narrative. I'm not saying its not true. I am saying I don't know. It seems like something I latched onto to explain why I suffer to myself. That each experience I had in succession was to build upon the next to achieve or fulfill my purpose.

I want that all to be true but my attachment to it must cease. 

So the weird that that happened that I cannot find reconciliation for yet is I saw someone shapeshift one time. Its the ONLY spiritual phenomena that happened to me that I cannot find a logical fallacy in in my memory. The person was introduced as highly spiritual. It was an informal setting. He waited til we were alone in the room and asked a question that set him up for the shifting. He then turned his head, voice and personality into the person he asked about for about 4 seconds. Shifted back and just smiled at me until the other person came in the room moments later. Perfectly socially executed psychic-like prank to fuck with my head seemingly. 

So, from the place of it not being ""god"" or representative of a higher power. And assuming I wasn't hallucinating which in this instance, I really don't think I was. This was either a psychic or an alien right? This wasn't a heightened conscious experience given receptive state I was in or something? 

People that meditate often stick to cold raw meaningless reality and that spirituality is hallucinatory in nature. So what did I experience?

I'm on the hunt for a week-long wellness getaway in India where I can unplug and unwind, but with a twist – I need my fix of non-veg options! 

Any suggestions? Whether it's a serene spot in the Himalayas or a cozy hideout tucked away in the countryside, I'm open to all recommendations. Ideally, looking for spots that offer programs lasting around a week or ten days. 

I'm interested in places where I can take a break from the hustle and bustle of daily life, disconnect from technology and social media, and focus on relaxation, mindfulness, and personal growth.

I am not deep in the meditation world by any means, but have enjoyed it off and on for years. When I was a child I had somewhat of a restless fever dream type experience. It was so powerful that I remember it to this day. I'm a 27 year old male. It sounds bizarre and is so hard to explain, but I was in a restless sleep and felt a sensation in this dream state like a silver pinball spiraling around my head at vicious speeds. Like it was a Bey-Blade and my head was the arena lol. It felt like I couldn't get it to stop. It was extremely uncomfortable and memorable and I had it happen a couple other times.  
  
A few weeks ago, I was meditating on my bed. I've been using the belly as a focus point a lot lately. I was deep into a session (This one was a guided session on the Calm app) when I became aware of the sensation of a silver ball resting serenely and perfectly in my belly.  
  
I always felt like I was sort of an anxious/freaked out child and have battled with mental health issues as an adult pertaining to anxiety and this experience gave me so much peace and understanding. It told me that all of this crazy energy that I have can be centered down into a deeper, lower part of my being, and that it doesn't have to be flying around in my chest and head all the time.

Interested to have a discussion here. I understand mindfulness is often about getting out your own head and feeling through your emotions, feeling the body and releasing tension etc.

As much as I try to do this, when I feel a little stressed, anxious about things, I often feel the need to speak to myself, give myself advice and ‘talk my way’ out of my mental barriers I’ve given myself

But does this go against mindfulness? I feel mindfulness teachers always preach to ‘get out your head’ and into your emotions, that you can’t talk your way out of stress and anxiety

Every guy I ever remotely liked, I got attached, put them up on a pedestal and couldn't stop thinking about them.

Yesterday, after a conversation I had with a guy I'd been obsessed with lately, I realised that I couldn't do this to myself anymore. Feeling miserable when this guy feels down, completely high when this guy was in a good mood etc. It reached a point where I was just plain exhausted at the suffering and inner roller coaster and turmoil that I seemed to be perpetually in. I heard a monk say before, that suffering is not just feeling pain, but that it was pleasure and pain combined. And I guess I suddenly understood what he meant by that. I was sick of pleasure too and finally could see the futility of it.

So I started meditation for the first time today. I felt like I had no say or choice in this. Like my body craved anything to PLEASE let myself breathe mindfully for one moment without all the compulsive actions of the day. It lasted about 20 mins before I felt the need to stop doing it, but I honestly felt like I could do it for hours if I had really tried. It was very peaceful and calming. Whenever I had intrusive embarrassing thoughts of my past actions, I remembered that I was home alone, just sitting in peace and that thought lessened in power over me. It felt so good to focus on my body and almost for the first time to actually properly acknowledge it. It really did feel somewhat 'ecstatic' and exciting and invigorating. A high that comes from having ALL of the mental burden and rubbish released, at least for that moment.

I also felt much sadness and grief. I wept multiple times. I realised that in all of those times I acted out of character just to get validation and attention from certain guys, they were all actions that arose out of deep sadness and longing that goes back to childhood. A child only rightfully desperate to be loved back. I felt great compassion for my past self who went through all that she did, and who didn't know any better. Who did the best she could with what she had.

I truly understand the power of meditation and stillness now. It feels like I found a long lost friend who now always has my back. I feel like I'm not alone anymore.

I wake up with a thickness in my throat and a stuffy nose. My 12am meeting will have to be postponed. I have slept a long, unruly sleep, having woken up frequently during the night due to my condition.

Without a clear agenda for the day or plans to relate to, I decide to sit down on my couch and meditate. My initial intention is to prepare myself mentally for an important meeting tomorrow.   
Lately my quiet practice has gone well and I surprise myself almost every day, prolonging the time spent in silence. Thirty minutes become forty minutes. Forty minutes become fifty minutes, and so on.

It is by all means an exhilarating journey I have embarked on and I try my best to let go of my expectations during every session. The less I try to see, the more is shown. Often.

This day my ambitions are not put high. My whistling nose and thick throat don't seem like prime conditions for mental stillness. 

Boy was I wrong.

For some time I have put my focus into my eyes during meditation. Thoughts are at this point quite easy to manage but my eyes tend to live their own life, vibrating back and forth trying to find a focal point. I experiment with different types of focus, ""zooming"" in and out trying to find the golden middle way. What has seemed to work the best so far is letting my eyes roll up, as they seem to want that. This is something I have always experienced, long before my spiritual journey began. When maintaining a soft focus, my eyes roll up ever so slowly, like as if attached to an old rubber band.

When my eyes find rest in this position during meditation, colors start to emerge. Always purple or sometimes deep blue. At first it appears as a small speck with wobbling borders. If I succeed in not concentrating on the emerging speck of color, it grows and starts envelope my inner vision, turning into a big cloud. The moment my eyes attach focus to it, it diminishes.   
After I while I start seeing *eyes* through the mist of my mind, never as a pair, but one eye in different shapes and forms. 

This has been a state I have grown somewhat familiar with as I have played around with it. What I experienced today was quite the opposite of familiar.

I embrace the purple cloud and rest in it with peculiar ease as I manage to silence the voice telling me that my throat needs to swallow the build up of saliva or that my thigh is sore from the position I am seated. I don't recall precisely when or how, but all of a sudden and without any kind of premonition, my internal sight explodes into kaleidoscopic, big colors in all shapes and forms vibrating of golden light. I would describe it to what you would see from googling "" DMT-trip"" or similar as I have no experience of the drug. Through this beautiful spectacle of shapes, color and light a face is produced in the midst of it all. As the neck, shoulders and arms start to appear I feel a bolt of warm, comforting pleasure run down my spine and through my entire body as I shiver and get goosebumps all over. 

I immediately ""return"" to my body and the visuals disappear as fast as they arrived as these physical sensations unfold and a feeling of divine confidence runs through me. I half-assedly try to regain the state I just left for a while but quickly realise that my ego is too excited from the experience.  
I rise from the couch, laughing as I walk up to the mirror and meet the most genuine smile.

&#x200B;

This has been a great day and I felt the need to share it with the world.

My practice of this has followed a few steps:

1. I started with mdma-therapy. MDMA creates a sense of intense compassion and safety.  I used that feeling to revisit my traumatic memories and rewrite the maladaptive and overwhelming feelings and beliefs associated with them. 
2. After around 25 mdma sessions over 3 years I started being able to do something similar without the medicine. Whenever I felt an old maladaptive pattern activate, I recalled the memory of one of my mdma sessions. I used that memory of safety and compassion to do the rewriting.  
3. After a hundred hours or so of that practice, I realized I didn’t need either that deliberate series of steps (recalling the mdma memory and sitting with it while it rewrote the distress) or the medicine at all. I could just “flip a switch” in my head and I could send an intense amount of safety and love to whatever distressing memory was activating and rewrite it. I can do this almost anytime I want, even while doing some other activity. I do get exhausted after about 2 hours and then need a full nights sleep to recharge the ability. I’ve done several hundred hours of it and haven’t noticed any downsides other than temporary exhaustion Its been exceptionally effective, and even works when I’m panicking or dissociating.

And as well as I’m interested in focusing on the 963hz frequency, which is said to be beneficial for awakening and healing. If anyone has experience working with this frequency or knows where I can find sound samples in this range, your guidance would be greatly appreciated.

I often have a purple/indigo pulsing orb that appears while I’m meditating. Sometimes flashes of people or places that I don’t know. I’ve accepted this as being a good sign and tied to my third eye and try to not focus on it too much and keep my mind clear.

Lately, however, I’ve had two experiences where a white spinning light appeared - spinning very quickly. And then suddenly a pulsating, bright magenta orb came into my vision and then shifted into a chaotic scribble of lines being drawn in the middle of the spinning white light. Imagine handing a toddler a magenta marker and them scribbling a congested web of lines. I even opened my eyes for a moment and when I closed them it was still happening for quite some time. I felt completely out of body and then my whole body tensed.

The whole experience kind of freaked me out for a few days and I stopped meditating for a bit. Has anyone experienced something similar or have any insight?

I was introduced to meditation about 3 years ago by a friend. The way I was told about it was that you are to simply just sit, relax, and let your mind wander. 

Out of curiosity I had just searched up meditation and realized I was completely wrong. The goal is to be completely in the moment, focused. Yet I can’t seem to reach that level of awareness / calm(?)

Whenever I attempt to meditate, my mind runs off to all these thoughts in my head. Whether they be insecurities, doubts, or general worries about my personal life. I’ve no idea how to stop it and I guess that’s why I’m afraid to admit there’s a little fear everytime I meditate.

Ive had month long periods of meditation before i got sick where its helped me alot, but now i find it really hard not to overthink if im «doing it right». 
I Get especially really caught up in the start and end of meditations sessions where i body scan, try to notice sounds around me or try to put into words how i feel atm. 

Did i notice how my toes felt clearly enough?

How do i really feel rn? Did it just change do i have to say something new?

Did i focus hard enough on the sounds? Do i have to keep listening till i Get a clearer picture?

Although i struggle alot less during the main part
I also often feel like i have to answer questions in my head abt the exercise or how im «performing» Even tho i know i should just focus on the breath. 

Did i note that thought «well enough»?

Was that thought distracting enough to notes

Its really disheartening to keep doing this when Even after those sessions where i find focus and abit of calm, i just end up feeling sad and anxious bc i Get caught up in the technique at the end. Also feels like this has made me overthink more outside the excersise. Anyone else struggle with this? 

Right now im using a «managing anxiety» course on headspace, dont know if i should change it.

So I was reading a great book by entrepreneur Brad Jacobs- one of the most successful businessmen to grow companies in record time. He meditates twice a day and credits most of his success to it. Once in the morning and once at night- fifteen minutes each. He talks about this practice called “Feeling your brain”. He says if you stare at your hands long enough you go into this trance-like subconscious state. But instead of his hands, he directs his mind to his brain and experiences the same profound feeling, but magnified, this is where all his best ideas come from.

Does anybody here want to elaborate on this or perhaps offer a more detailed description on what this man is talking about?

I am in a tropical country so no snow.  
For me to relate I interpreted it to ""Only miss the sun when it is gone"".  
Processing this in my head... I said, hmmm yeah, if there was no sun, life on earth wouldn't exist. This made me appreciate the sun.  
  
Still listening to the music, I went to check the comments section, the line came up again but this time I changed it to ""Only miss the comments when it is gone"", I focused on that thought,  
""Only miss the humans when it is gone"", because after all these comments are made by humans, even the comments made by bots (because bots are made by humans sooo...lol).  
I suddenly felt grateful for everyone in that comment section.   
  
This made me thank the sun again, because without it, there would be no humans nor youtube comments.  
But then I thought, why just the sun? the sun isn't the only thing responsible to human existence, so I thanked the moon too for creating tides.  
Then a domino effect of thanking happened.  
  
I thanked the gravity for holding the sun and moon in place.  
I thanked the earth for spinning and creating the atmosphere.  
I thanked the ozone layer for protecting humans from too much sunlight.  
I thanked the earth for allowing me to walk.  
I thanked my feet and legs for letting me walk in the first place,  
I thought to myself why just the feet and legs? So, I thanked my whole body,  
Again, I thought to myself why do I even have this body?  
Because of my parents! I thanked my parents.  
I thanked my ancestors, not just them but all of humanity too (the dead and existing).  
  
Suddenly, I found myself thanking everything:  
Every grass for producing oxygen,  
Even the bugs I dislike, like cockroaches! I thanked them for their role in the food chain!  
With closed eyes and hands like this 🙏, I was crying with tears of realization. All my life I have taken these things for granted. Not even batting an eye.  
I felt a sense of warm hug (or is it just my blood), so many things could go wrong for a human not to exist and yet here I am held together by the sun and moon and everything.  
  
After saying thanks for so many things, I felt emptiness inside me because there was nothing left to thank to.  
I tried to thank this emptiness, but it felt wrong.   
  
I thanked because of the existence of things, not their absence.  
  
I realized that this emptiness is the one thanking for everything because it is everything that is not something.

I was very drowsy and almost surrendering to sleep while sitting in how many hours it was for that particular day of meditation marathon. I had this intense pain in my legs which I had accepted and relaxed with. While bodyscanning drowsily, I reached again my legs, simultaneosly nodding while almost falling asleep, then this intense jolt happened: my spine straightened immediately, my awareness of the whole room and my body buzzing, by consciousness pushed backwards like to the back seat if I were a car, the limits of my body felt non existent, just this massive vibration and buzzing, the body scanned itself on its own and I was observing from what felt as from the backside. Leg pain completely gone just this dissolving feeling of the whole body, ears hearing sound of sand moving under water. 
Realized that this is happening, that it will pass and might not happen again so better not get attached to it, but really enjoyed the moment that felt like it lasted for a few minutes, like maybe 3.

 Afterwards felt super calm, clear-headed and 0% tired.

Meditating with my senior residents has been something I've considered for a while. I personally try and meditate regularly myself and have gained a decent ""skill"" for it. I have done a bit of fishing and found that it may be something our residents may take an interest in. I would give them a brief introduction to how meditation works and our goals and probably pass them on to some sort of purposeful, guided meditation (from YouTube most likely).  


To get to **the point** here are my questions:  


* What concepts are important for me to iterate as an introduction to meditation for those who have never participated?
* Are there any techniques I should introduce before going into a guided meditation or just let the guided meditation do it's thing?
* Any recommendations for concept or emotional focuses that I should select for our guided meditation that may appeal to a senior audience?

As an avid psychonaut I have been in these states many times and meditation while sober does that for me as well under the right circumstances. I do it laying down with a blindfold starfish posed on the bed and binaural beats in my headphones. 

It is hard to explain but to achieve this state I sort of have to “flex” a muscle in my brain, or at least that is how it feels. I would compare it to when you were a child trying to flex your brain to see if you can make something levitate to see if you have superpowers. I employ no special breath work and tend to not really focus on breathing at all. I know it is working once I have the strange phenomenon of thinking that suddenly my eyes are open underneath the blindfold only to realize they are still shut when I try to close them. 

After about 10 minutes my entire body begins to tingle until I lose feeling throughout my body and that tingling moves into my head and I feel a huge surge of dopamine. Under this trance like state I experience a myriad of effects such as CEVs, floating/flying sensations, and the feeling of an expansive consciousness and overall a very psychedelic feeling mindscape. Sometimes this transforms into a sort of half awake lucid dreaming type state and I always fall asleep before the hour mark and proceed to have insanely vivid dreams.

I’m wanting to dig deeper in this type of meditation and I’m wondering if there is a specific name or style that this would be designated as so I can research it. Is this what people call “astral projection” or is that something else? Could this be some form of some endogenous chemical like DMT going on? What are some strategies I can employ to try to go deeper and avoid falling asleep?

He said something along the lines of ""you're more of a dreamer. I'm more of a doer."" It kind of hurt me because he thinks that I don't do anything. He just thought I sat there daydreaming all day. To him looking in on the outside he saw me sitting around, drawing, playing PlayStation, or whatever.   
To explain I used to work for this guy who has a pilates business and a creative space here in LA. He let me use the creative place as a sort of studio to work on my art when I wasn't working. Eventually it got to the point where he wanted me to become something I wasn't. He wanted me to dress a certain way and become a salesman because he wanted to turn the creative space into a storefront. It wasn't something I wanted to be and I went my separate ways.   
He didn't realize that I do do things. He just doesn't see me when I am doing things and getting results. I just take action when I am inspired and motivated. It's different than forcing something like you know pounding the pavement and exhausting yourself until something happens. I don't like forcing things and putting tons of effort into something.  
Ever since I was young I've been a dreamer type. Sort of off in La La Land. I remember one time I was sitting in class and we were working on a group project. I was just sort of staring down not really doing anything. The teacher asked me ""are you contemplating your navel?""  
My former boss knew I was spiritual and into like ""woo woo"" kinds of things. It just felt like a sort of personal attack when he said it that way.   
Over the years I've kind of rejected my imagination and thought of it kind of like a curse in a way. It's because of people like my former boss or people in my family. People that thought day dreaming was a bad thing. I think in some ways it meant that I wanted to be somewhere anywhere but where I was.  
Anyways, I don't know if this is the place to talk about this or not. I know it's a subreddit about meditation. I just wanted to ask some of you if you felt it was bad or not advantageous to be a dreamer? I know you have to take action at some point in some way. I just don't think it has to feel hard and exhausting. There are different types of people. I realize that.

Was meditating and trying to focus on my breathing. Got lost in a really interesting stream of thought that feels really insightful and helps with my anxiety.

Namaste.

So when I meditate my goal is usually to focus on my breath. I hear the thoughts in the mind coming and going but one thought stream captured my focus.

It was about the control I do not have. I do not have control over what thoughts manifest in the mind. No person does. I am merely witnessing a relationship of self and universe. 

I then received in thought that anything that happens is a result of that relationship. The self is receiving from the universe and the universe is receiving from the self. 

Then what am I? I could say I am the self but the self seemingly dissolves into nothing placing me in a state of non-being. When I am awake, the self is and I am. When the self is not and I am not.

But can I be that which forms the self? Like I am the Universe, the Tao, The All. I don’t know how to describe it but maybe I am that which is formless in a state of non-being yet has form in a state of being. I am in essence the ocean of spirit concentrated in a single drop with all the power to manifest, create and destroy, do or not do when the self has formed into a state of being. I am as free to be and experience and express as the universe is in its existence. I am completely free.

But I am an illusion. Things are just happening and there is nothing I can actually control. This avatar is just doing as his spirit wills. It’s like this universe is manifested inside the mind of some great being who’s dreaming or meditating but that great being is me, so if I were to wake up or stop meditating as that great being I’d wake up in a universe similar to this one. Meaning I could essentially wake up in that one as well and endlessly outward in realities. Like a fractal.

Like woah man. It’s really interesting to observe thoughts streams and go inwardly like that. Been meditating for a few years now and this year has been full of awesome thought streams like that. 

Have any input? Any cool ideas? Has meditation brought you strange, scary, or insightful thought stream? Would love to know.

I'd love to share with you this information, I have been meditating for 7 years, running corporate meditations weekly and coaching people on grounding their energy (manifested thoughts) from the mind to 4th energy centre. ❤
Understanding the specific emotion (energy in motion) generated from 1-3 (survival) centres.

1. Stress - Meditation reduces cortisol released from amygdala which can dull the immune system. This can lead to long-lasting changes in pain, memory, attention regulation and reducing inflammation. 💢

2. Memory - Long term memory benefits as hippocampus increases through mediation practice additionally problem solving benefits and working memory is increased. 🧠

3. Breath - Focusing on the breath we change the brain and bodies chemistry (psychosomatic response) to reduce anxiety, lower blood pressure and change the heart rate. Belly breathing (from diaphragm) maximises blood gas exchange. 1-day breathing exercise was found to relieve the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization induced by job burnout. 🌬

4. Nervous System - During high workload meditation can help activate the parasympathetic nervous system and downregulates the sympathetic nervous system. This allows deeper attention, focus and increased creativity. Increasing productivity, decision making and performance. ⚙

1. When you don’t resist your thoughts but rather accepting them, isn’t that “acceptance” a thought in your mind that says “okay work on accepting this thought”? How is that awareness in that 

2. When I thought pops up, I’ve learned to let it be, to give it energy, and note / label the thought then return to breath / physical sensations. But what about planning important stuff such as when I will sit down to study, or looking back at wonderful nostalgic memories with my family, should I just don’t let those thoughts be in my head either?

3. I can’t seem to stay present for more than 3 second or so, both when I meditate and in everyday life. Is that normal for a beginner (I’ve meditated everyday for almost a week, but I e meditate for maybe 1-2 months maybe 1-2 times a week it just last week I’ve started doing it everyday)

4. Sometimes when I focus on my breath and I am aware of it, I still have thoughts in the back of my head, like they never disappear completely, why is that and how do I stay fully present?

5. When I return to the present in everyday life should I focus on the breath or what I see, sensations etc?

6. How bad is screen time before and after meditation, that my biggest problem to get rid of. I can’t seem to stop being on my phone or other devices.

I still have a hard time understanding what everything means in terms of accepting thoughts, and watching them, it’s hard to know the feeling when these tools are applied, maybe that’s something that clears with time.

Will update my meditation journey here and really loookinf forward to be able to understand or at least know that what is do is the “right” way, so I can keep practicing it and not practice with the “wrong” techniques :)

I am not a devotee of meditation, I rather let myself be carried away by daily life, which despite painful episodes comforts me while being sometimes very limiting.
During this session, and because of my lack of confidence, diligence and discipline I was able to contemplate my life, space and time and navigate through it all of my own free will.
The scary part, happened when I was contemplating the idea of infinity and felt the irrelevance of duality and this dream. 
Trying to picture it, I was seeing my life in a cube, with fast images of my past and present, displaying inside of it. Then I was able to zoom in and out to acknowledged all the different dreams, scenarios and possibilities.
I quite enjoyed these sensations but eventually I realized, if I am able to control this perception and if I feel these infinite possibilities, there are realities where I am actually dead, where only dark, chaos, black holes and being lost in time actually exist. This is where I felt a panic attack, my breath came short, my heartbeat accelerated, my whole body reacted and I was scared. It took an herculean effort to go back to the present moment and a lot of positive thinking. 
As I mentioned above, since this experience, I sometimes contemplate these thoughts and carry around these scary feelings for a few minutes in my daily life. 
I am not quite sure if I should try to mediate again or take a break.


On the bright side, this meditation opened the realm of imagination and allow me to refocus on the present, to appreciate it and above all to switch to active mode, to make my own choices and to write my life and my future. Discovering what really makes me happy and daring to live my life.

Certainly silent time can be troublesome if not guided properly, stewing in your own trubulent mind is never a good idea for long.  This is why (usually) retreats should have certain breaks and other activities to break the monotony and give a little venting of the participants.

I have been exploring my spiritual self after leaving my religion last week. The truth has always been the most important thing to me, and I knew I couldn't find my answers by staying in one place. I was conforming to a single ideology and the people around me were more than happy to have me there. This was comforting, but soon became disturbing. The idea that I was a place holder only made the bars of my mental prison stronger. I made them stronger. I left my religion without grace, but held onto to pursuit of truth. The spirit stayed with me as well. The warm feeling I would get while praying never left me. 

Someone told me to look into ""Jungian Psychology"" and told me I was ""on the right path."" The ""Warm Spirit"" told me this was true. 

After taking their advice, my mind and eyes were opened to another universe of possibilities. A universe that was always there, but I was blind to it due to my indoctrination and fear of my conceptualized God. 

I've spent the last week devouring the content of Carl Jung and reading 2 of his books. I learned that I should embrace my ""shadow self"" instead of suppressing it, and I immediately understood that I had been sabotaging my spirit for almost 2 decades. Through the process of ""Individuation"" I was able to learn that I already possessed the tools required to be ""free"" and I was willfully ignoring them. 

Jordan Peterson has said something along the lines of ""You must deal with past trauma in order to be truly present to map your current and possible future landscapes."" This stuck with me, as I had loads of negative memories that I hadn't worked through. He has also stated that ""The thing you desire most is where you least want to look.""

This led me to reading about Zen meditation. The art of truly existing in the moment was a foreign concept to me. 

My son went down for his nap and I thought ""I think Ill try being present and meditating.""

At first, all I could do was think about this and that as my mind kept racing, but I kept saying to myself ""You are here."" When my mind would wander I would repeat this phrase. I repeated this phrase until there was no movement in my mind. Then an entire lifetime of negative memories came flooding out of me. I was in tears but I wanted them to come over me. I wanted to accept them. Those memories were replaced by the good memories I had completely forgotten about and I cried even harder. I saw a friend who died in 2016 and he smiled at me. I became overwhelmed and smiled back in tears. I had never truly dealt with the pain of his loss. I didn't even cry at his funeral. I let these memories flow over me. Soon I was on a mountain letting the light and wind hit me. There was tall grass and the sun was setting. I went higher and was part of the universe or what appeared to be the milky way or some kind of cosmic eye? It was as if space was trapped inside a giant eye. 

I cant describe the feeling I have now. There is no fear. Its just acceptance of what is or something like that. 

Never stop perusing the truth. No matter how much pain and suffering you are in. There is a bigger picture surrounding us. 

Maybe I had beginner's luck, but I feel like I know myself better and my path has never been brighter.

anyway...i get up and go back to go to sleep. and as soon as i leave the bathroom i had a insane sense of terror come over me. i felt like someone was standing very close to me. i get to my bedroom freakedout. i lay in my bed paranoid. thinking ""im just tripping out. there is no one in my house""

I can't really describe what I felt, I just know that after the guide told to imagine myself hand in hand with one person I'm quite open with, and to imagine myself telling to that person ""may we be happy"", in that exact moment, I just cried like a baby, and still brings tears to me eyes as I think about it and repeat it in my head.

Never experienced something like this, never, and never thought I would.

Nothing more, just wanted to share this with someone else, and maybe understand better what may be going on or something.

*This is a technique that helped me a lot when I was a beginner. I've been commenting this technique here and there so I figured it's time for a post.*   
  
Back when thoughts were still taking the better of me (especially very negative, very intrusive, constantly ongoing, thoughts) this practice was agitating, but...

**It showed me the first gap of silence between my thoughts!**

""A(aaa).... B(eee).... C(eee)... D(eee)....""

Then decide a letter at which you're going to stop. It's a pattern of letters. Break it. Hear the silence.

It will just be a split second. Keep going. Keep going even when you get tired of your thoughts. At some point, your mind even gets tired from the thinking.

There is no point of it. There is no satisfaction or dopamine from constant thoughts. Your mind will realize this, not just understand (c.q. I am sure you know it, but your mind needs to truly realie it).

A... B... C... D.... E... F... .... \*stop\*.

Silence. This time a bit longer than just a split second.

Is there a thought arising? ""Ah, a thought"", oh look ""thinking"" is happening.   
  
Bring your attention back to your breath (or to whatever else you were focussed on). Thoughts come and go, you are not your thoughts.

My first experiences of not having thoughts wash all over me, was through this technique. Having had that experience made it easier to understand meditation and how to reach those states. 

It's been years now. When I sit, thoughts just pass by in the background. It's training! (By the way, this technique comes from Vipassana) :)

## Why?  
- Meditation is a transformative practice. But, developing a meditation practice can be hard.

## What?  
- A quick 10 min meditation.  
- Feel free to BYOM - bring your own meditation style.  
- I will provide quick instructions for beginners  
- This is not about the type of meditation  
- Rather, it is about providing a space for meditation.

I have Tourette's Syndrome, which gets worse and better cyclically between 9 and 15 months. This is an established pattern for the last 30 something years of my life.

Right now, I am at one of the greatest peaks of intensity in that cycle. I cannot drive, use fine motor skills very well etc. It puts me off balance just sitting in a chair sometimes. I also have vocal tics which affect my breathing pattern to the point of completely irregular breath.

I have usually used my breath as a locus of awareness when my thoughts get cluttered and I need to come back to something. 

I have been using a candle since the breath is not always doable, but my head and shoulders jerk around every 3 seconds and I can't really focus on it.

In my case personally I used to have this problem very intensely and in certain situation it would lead to panic attacks, although in the vast majority of cases it wouldn't. It would sort of feel like a dream, a bit cloudy and it kinda had that 'absurdness' of a wacky dream. My senses would become super hightened, hearing, sound, everything, and more importanty it would sort of feel like i was an observer inside my head...if that makes sense. Like out of body, but in my head lol. 

I DONT think anything spiritual was going on, I do believe my brain was just being weird and it's probably a genetic thing. 

Like I said in most cases, I wouldn't have a panic attack. It feels kinda cool. But, you just never know what these things could lead to, and I've read stories about meditation induced psychosis so it's a bit worrying. 

Would it be worth talking to a doctor about it at least? I really enjoy meditation and I cannot afford to find a teacher or a spiritual instructor or something like that. I don't do anything intense, literally just trying to focus on my breath for 20 minutes every few days. I had derealization years ago, and it wasn't until I started meditation that those feelings came back up again, ESPECIALLY the observer thing I mentioned earlier. 

I do attribute these feelings to meditation because it usually happens after these sessions, but even when I don't do them for some time, I still get those feelings, and like i said I only started to get them after meditation...or really any kind of grounding or focusing technique. If I intentionally try to notice colors, sounds, etc., around me, if I really focus on my senses, I get that feeling. It's very scary but like I said sometimes its fun, especially if I'm out in nature.

I've heard that the result of meditation the realization that 'none of this is real', life is qualitatively the same as a dream. But I've heard this only happens after literal years of devoted practice, not after only a few months of inconsistent tries.

&#x200B;

I have been meditating on and off for a while, untill I realized that there would probably be an online community about meditation and tadaa! there you are. I wanted to share some of my experiences since I have literally no one in my social environment with whom i can share experiences with, and I have no clue if I am doing the right thing or not.

Background: I got into meditation because of therapy. I have been doing brainspotting, which is a form of EMDR. From this, I went to some brainspot-exercises at home, at the instruction of my therapist. This evolved into me learning about chakra's and explaining sensations with the use of chakra's. This then evolved into meditations specifically for chakra's. 

So I currently do 3 different meditations, about one per day. I started a couple of years back, but back then the experience and aftermath was often so intense i didn't dare to do more than about once per month. 

Meditation one is focussed on the heart chakra, the one which has a lot of healing to do it would seem. For this i use a Guided meditation.  I feel like i need to do this one a lot, and this one seems to have most emotional effect. The thing is though that lately, I have a hard time focussing on this one, And it often leaves me more angry than with a feeling of love.

The second one is for my throat chakra, I basically just ""sing"" along with a chant on spotify. I first listen to it 1 time to get focussed, then i chant along 2 times (it's only about 5 minutes long). This meditation is the hardest work, and I mostly need some sort of ""cooldown"" afterwards. And It's pretty cool, because during this after meditation I always feel so relieved, and I kind of ""dream"" for a little while, where i see lots of colors and patterns and frames, but I also sometimes see made up images of people i care(d) about. All in all it's a pretty cool but intense experience.

The third and last meditation I just listen to an hour long track, for as long as I can, and I try to focus as long as I can. Most times i lose focus @ about 24 minutes. This experience is very very similar to the brainspotting experiences I have had. Last time I had an insane mandatory pull on my eyes, pulling my eyes far into the left upper corner of my sockets, and for a moment I got overwhelmed by such an intense feeling of sadness, I even teared up. 

The day after meditations I can often feel a bit lightheaded and even a bit shaky on my legs, as if I have a hangover. I am not afraid of the experience anymore, but it is as if ""feeling fine"" translates to ""feeling hangoverish"" with me. 

So why am I sharing this? Because I don't know WHY i do this. I still ruminate like hell. I am still angry a lot of times about things and people of my past. I still don't feel like I am starting to understand myself or life better. I still feel anxious a lot. Am I missing something? Apart from most meditations being pleasant experiences (Almost addictive), I don't feel any contribution to my life and mental wellbeing yet. Can anyone enlighten me on this?

When I read about mindfulness or meditation and practice it, I always wonder how to balance observation and action. 

Let's say someone makes a joke about me in front of other people and I feel embarrassed. I understand that reacting while I feel triggered will probably backfire. 

But if I don't say anything isn't that enabling the other person to not respect my boundaries? 

Some teachers like Michael Singer (if I'm understanding him correctly) would say that the reason I suffer in that situation is because I expect reality to be a certain way and because I need people to treat me in a certain way to feel loved. According to this logic, if I let go of that expectation and need I wouldn't care if someone makes that joke.

so, the last few days and tonight, i decided to just let thoughts and feelings come with no judgment, and i try my best to observe them.

while meditating, i caught myself in a special feeling, sort of trance like, and out of nowhere i couldnt help but giggle and i just let myself smile while i was sitting on my bed. i felt a fuzzy feeling around my body and it just felt like a special moment of peace and content. 

at that point, its when i really felt like meditating is actually legit, and something really special. I'm not sure if i should cling onto that feeling i felt, or let it just be a feeling of the past and move on with life.

I deal with low mood. I've been diagnosed with depression.  I try to not use that word often because it can put me in a mind-frame of having less control, less power and even less hope. 


I find meditation not very difficult and I'm often left feeling more calm and focused. I can achieve some hopefulness by using meta practice. 
I haven't seen much progress in becoming more energetic. I do get a small amount of energy from exercising but not as much as a lot of people claim to feel. 

I'm wondering if there's any practices that I could try that might activate more energy in my body? 

I believe I've heard that kundalini could help but I'm a little skeptical. I am more of a pragmatist and steer away from anything requiring a belief in something unscientific. But maybe there is some research behind kundalini. I haven't spent any time looking for that.

1. I lay down in my bed, legs equidistant and arms at my sides palm down and close my eyes, making sure I feel comfortable but even as well.

2. I won’t move at all. No blinking, swallowing (unless required, have choked before) or any hand movements at all. Only thing I focus on is breathing and what I can see in my eyes behind my eyelids.

3. After awhile, I’ll get little pins and pricks and urges to scratch something on my body. I will mentally focus on those feelings to assert them as being a mirage and they fade when I stop thinking about them and accept them. I know that if I feel them I’m on the way, and get somewhat excited when I do.

4. I keep focussing on breathing and let my internal monologue talk, not too fast but I keep it on a storyline, or sometimes I’ll focus on counting breaths. I’ll even sometimes move my eyes around in a circle and I’ll see stars (like I’m looking up at a night sky) and focus on them.

5. Eventually my hands start to feel like they’re sinking into the bed, or at least I lose the sensation of their location, same with my legs.

6. After ‘distracting’ myself from this feeling by thinking about stuff, eventually I feel what I call the ‘drop’, where this wave of warmth and weight? Comes over me. Only thing I can really equate it to is it’s like my body has ‘fallen asleep’ but my mind is still awake. Breathing is still being controlled though.

7. I’m able to visualise stuff way clearer and my mind goes to different places, like I can ‘see’ what’s going on and I’m in control of it, normally this doesn’t really last long because the ‘drop’ happens so suddenly I feel a mixture of nerves and excitement because it happened, kinda like watching a kernel of popcorn in a pan, you know it’s gonna pop so you aren’t super afraid when it happens, but when it does the sudden shock surprises you.

8. I kinda keep going in and out of these drops until i kinda call is quits and pull myself back into movement. The feeling of ‘coming back’ is akin to waking up from a nap.

Overall these sessions last between 20-45 minutes, they obviously don’t feel that long, but I’m always shocked by how long I was out for.

On and off with some stuff but I can't even remember how much bullshit I swollowed. I think I would join a cult if someone asked.

Firstly, I am ashamed of myself for falling into some ""life changing mind altering"" schemes. My biggest regret is that I didn't stick with meditation and yoga, but it seems impossible to go back now. 

My mind is blank. I rarely experience an emotion other than irritability or self pitty. I don't allow myself to enjoy my accomplishments and am always looking for the next thing to stress about. 
I have no concentration anymore and am not able to enjoy a movie or series wich was one of my happiest hobbies. 
I am in constant worry that I will say, do or don't do something that may get my loved ones mad at me. I am a horrible people pleaser. I am too aware of my faults, and I'm less and less able to find my good sides. 

I have problems with addictions. Not serious drugs but i would say I am very gullible and would buy snake oil. My biggest addiction at the time is online gambling. It's so easy to start and so difficult to quit. 

I am not on the path, or any of the paths I wanted to be on. Im not even close to a path. I am floating somewhere in a sea of anxiety. I can't depend on people around me to be accepting of my mental state and I am not willing to share my private thoughts with them. They love me I know, but it's a hard pass. I live in a country where proffesional help is either expensive or patriarchal (you're like that becouse you dont have children or husband). That may be true. But I would not reccomend me to anyone at this state. 

Sorry for rambling. My question is. Is the work I am willing to direct to Meditation worth it, and will it at least help me in some aspects of my life.  I.e. gambling, iritability... 

Everyone has something to say huberman, goddard, dispenza... i just can't anymore. Rules rules rules. And i just feel stupid for wasting my time. 

I don't expect to find support outside myself, amd Im ok with that. What would be your advice?
What simple routine would you add just for a tiny upgrade. And I'll go from there.

Sorry for my english and long post. I would be happy if anyone responds

What's the purpose of being here? Paramahansa Yogananda said we're here ""to entertain and to be entertained"".

Don't take things so seriously.

Nothing is born and nothing dies. No one slays and no one is slain. It's all the divine lila or play.

You might see war on a movie screen, but the screen is unaffected. Even in the movie, the actors are just playing a role. They don't think there's any danger because there is none.

Also, when fear comes, don't run from it. Turn around and face it and it'll disappear. It's not real. Whatever you give energy to appears real. You give it reality, in a sense. Again, it's your play, have fun.

Liberation and bondage belong to the mind alone. If you think ""I'm liberated"" you are. Then again, if you think ""I'm bound"" you are as well.

If you want a different reality, change your perception. Remember the phrase ""I think; therefore, I am"" and use it wisely.

Awakening means identifying with what you are and shedding the false. Like a snake sheds its skin and becomes new, so can you, if you realize yourself as eternal consciousness.

Awakening means what it implies. We're asleep to our nature. We're enjoying the divine lila, but it gets old after a while. Pleasures can't ultimately satisfy us. Pleasure and pain are polarity, yin and yang, and a part of God's maya. There's nothing in the world that can sustain us. That's why looking within is the only way.

Again, not everyone will understand this and that's okay. I don't know more than anyone else. I know nothing because everything is mysterious. I don't have the words. Silence revealed what I needed to know. Words and thoughts just got in the way.

Have a great day everyone 🫂

P.S. if you don't understand any of this, don't worry. We all come to knowledge of the self in our own time.

I have practiced meditation (TM) for two months now and been feeling a lot calmer and less anxious. However, I just noticed that I am becoming detached from my emotions. This realization came during a workshop (human process laboratory) for my master's program, where I struggled to connect emotionally with others. The process involved around 10 people coming together and trying to understand themselves and each other better, through experience (often traumatic experiences) and feedback sharing. Previously, I'd be deeply affected by others' traumas, but now I'm more analytical. The feedback that I received from my facilitator was that I can relate to others at a cognitive level, but could not understand my own feelings after listening to their traumas and experiences. This, as suggested by them, is often a hindrance for me to connect with others and be social. Unsure if this change is positive or negative, especially after receiving negative feedback about my emotional disconnect.

So after lurking around the subreddit, reading different posts and reading all of your different experiences, and how your life has changes since starting the journey.

My problem is that I start the meditative process, sit for 10 minutes, (which is really hard, after a long period of relying on constant media, to calm my negative thoughts). But it's the consistency that im struggling with.

Over the past few years I've felt entirely calm and weened off with doctor's approval. The last few months I've had some anxiety inducing situations and I've had a handful of flare-ups. 

I've attempted vipassana per ""mindfulness in plain English"" on and off for about 4 years, without much progress. I've expressed an interest in TM for a while (not here to discuss whether a scam or not), and came to the conclusion I'd never settle my curiosity until I tried. The concept of having access to a teacher for life seemed like what I needed.

The first two days felt relaxed, I was slightly more energetic, and optimistic about pursuing this long term. Starting on day 3 I started to develop a headache, and by day 5 was experiencing brain fog, dissociation, emotional detachment, extra lethargy, heightened anxiety. I took extra time coming out and still all I wanted to do was crawl into bed. I explained this to my teacher who advised I tackle it at my own pace, and said that it may be a release of stress. He's confident I'm practicing the technique properly.

I stopped entirely, and took this time to ensure my daily life practices were a bit more stable - cold face washing, routine exercise, consistent sleep/wake times, less phone time/dopamine hits, and I started feeling considerably better after about a week. A few days ago I attempted a short, 5 minute meditation and within about 30 minutes, the same headache and brain fog returned, carrying into the next day. I am now at a point where I'm nervous to continue for fear of these feelings again.

Should I trust my gut and not pursue what feels bad? Or is there a reasonable amount of ""pushing through"" necessary while the potential for deep rooted emotions manifest? Is it possible TM has just gotten me to a certain place quicker and the same could happen with a consistent/intense practice of vipassana?

Every fear I have traces back to the single origin of wanting to stay alive. There is no escaping it. Suffering and death are the basis of reality and therefore the only good choice we have is love and compassion. 

I spent a lot of time trying to analyze my thoughts and correct the narrative not realizing that how involved I am with the narrative itself is the problem. There's no meaning or reason at all for anything when at once I thought there was. Its an incredible surrender. I believed so many things due to fear. That the universe is conscious, that numbers were everywhere showing themselves to me, that I was going to find the right practice to finally get rid of my anxiety. The anxiety will remain and my attachment to it will change. That's all. 

I saw more of the origin of my thought process. Even this post, I can see what compels me to make it. I choose to engage in it because otherwise I'd do absolutely nothing due to the meaninglessness of it all. Full involvement in life is the way to feel connection and purpose. Too much theorizing will just lead to inaction and endless toiling. 

I laid there on molly and just kept my eyes closed and invited the fear and depression and I watched it overwhelm and drag me into very low places and saw that all of them vanish at a single point which is never going to remit and then turn into love.

I’m noticing lately that during guided meditations I sometimes enter this state where I disconnect from my surroundings completely and am just “somewhere else” — the most recent experience I recall just having a conversation with some random character which I recall no details about appearance or what the conversation was about after returning to “normal consciousness”. It feels much different from being asleep but time passes super fast. 

I often come out of it feeling enlightened and much lighter like I had just read an interesting article or book. But recall no meaningful details for content. I plan to start journaling after exiting the state to see if I can glean any useful info.

So this post is dedicated to my former self who could have done with a materialist perspective on why meditation is about more than just making oneself “better”.

To say meditation has changed my life is an understatement. I’ve gone from being persistently depressed and anxious throughout my teens & twenties to a place where those words no longer make much sense experientially. More than that, it’s changed my very sense of identity, in a way that’s very difficult to explain in words.

There’s a common myth that we only really use 10% of our brains. Of course, our whole brain is operating all the time, but different neural pathways are strengthened when they’re used more frequently. That might mean that if we’ve learned to be afraid a lot, we’ll likely end up strengthening our fear pathways by being afraid all the time. If we've learned to suppress rage and let it build and build until it bursts out in a harmful way, that's the pathway that is reinforced.

That might make it seem like we’re doomed to repeat and even strengthen our conditioned patterns, but that’s exactly what meditation can interrupt.

Meditation in my experience is not about feeling good or being peaceful, it’s the practice of unwinding these very patterns (and many more that will surprise you).

Let me explain how I think it works. I’m not claiming any of this is scientifically proven, it’s just what seems to make sense in my own experience, and how it could be explained from a materialist perspective (although I no longer call myself a materialist).

We have a region of the brain that deals with language - planning sentences and recalling words that we’ve heard in the past. It’s very good at what it does… too good in fact. So good that we believe that that tiny part of the brain is the entirety of what we are.

It narrates our whole experience, says what we should and shouldn’t do, and judges us and others in the same way we’ve heard others judge. But if you watch closely, you’ll see very clearly that it’s just repeating echoes from the past. It’s simply learned behaviour. The problem comes when we act as though it is us, as if it is the authority. It seems to speak in first person after all. The reality is there is so much more of the brain that operates our body. Think about it - do you need a narrative thought in order to make your heart beat, or to breathe, or to catch yourself when you trip?

When we first start to meditate, we’re so used to operating from that language centre such that it tends to “do” the meditating. Narrating the process and judging our progress.

Simply watching thoughts can reveal a lot, but initially can be tough because those thoughts are so tempting and juicy and we just want to follow them.

But there’s a trick to get beneath the thoughts. It’s to go where they can’t access. Where there are no words. This is not exactly anything esoteric, it’s something very simple.

Find any neutral sensation in your body. Perhaps your body against the chair, or your feet on the floor. Now imagine that you had to explain that sensation to somebody who has never felt it before. Difficult right? You can use words that sort of get at it, but it’s like trying to explain the colour blue to someone with no sight.

If you cannot come up with the words to describe it, you’re in the right place. Stay there.

In noticing that sensation in its raw form, you’re engaging a different part of the brain than the language centre. Importantly, notice that the raw experience of a sensation feels more “real” than any thought that attempts to describe it.

This practice can lead to some very surprising discoveries. It can unwind long held patterns, and it can begin to feel as though the mind acts more holistically and harmoniously. More regions of the brain are getting attention, not just language and visualisation where the majority of us operate from. There’s something about this whole brain approach that feels, very subtly, like it reorganises itself and self-repairs.

A word of warning though. Because our learned habit is to go into the language centre (thoughts) to avoid uncomfortable emotions or sensations, unwinding this habit can make it seem like we’re becoming more emotional or in pain as those sensation and emotion pathways are reconnected. Meditation can feel initially good and then like we’re regressing. This is to be expected. If you have a lot of trauma or repressed emotion, although not strictly necessary it can be helpful to work with a professional or somebody who has been down this road before. Just know that it’s not always a linear path of always feeling good and peaceful, and the more willing you are to let go into the painful stuff the smoother it will be.

Slowly it becomes clear that even the so called painful emotions and sensations are not as painful as the thoughts make them out to be, and that they don't need to be avoided.

As for all the woo woo stuff and no longer being a materialist, don’t believe me, anybody or any religion about any of that. In fact everything that I've written means nothing compared to your actual direct experience.

I developed a crush on someone over the last few weeks and now - after she told me she wants to go on a date with me a couple of weeks from now - it has gotten to a point in which I want to think about her all the time because doing so brings me such pleasant sensations. I want to replay from my memory moments in which we’ve touched, hugged, kissed, and I want to daydream about future scenarios. And it all just feels soooo good. However, I also worry as I know it’s not a good idea for me to be daydreaming like this because usually beyond this point I get unhealthily obsessed and attached, and my fearful-avoidant attachment style comes up in full power. All this is an old pattern of mine which has happened countless times in the past, I get obsessed about being wanted and liked by the other person, while also needing space because they’re too much. I always end up feeling both overwhelmed, disappointed and hurt. I wish I would just think of her when I’m with her, and then when I’m with her I wish I would just let things flow instead of constantly fearing the ignition of the old pattern. Even if I know this, I’m so hooked to the good feelings that come with thinking of her that I don’t want to end them. I crave the feelings and the thoughts hard. Sometimes I try to veer away from the daydreaming, but as I’ll still be addicted to the feelings, I’ll find other ways to go about it so I’ll browse her social media a few times a day and smile looking at her photos. I wish I could just see her now so I could get it over with. I’ve noticed when I meditate that I really want to stay in those good feelings, so even if I tell myself to return to the breath, I also really strongly want to stay in that pleasant feeling just a little bit longer.

The world is an illusion, like seeing a snake in a rope. It was never there. It was just your imagination.

The wave comes out of the ocean and thinks ""this is me, I'm a wave"". It loses sight of it's vastness.

When images appear on a movie screen, we get so caught up in the movie that we lose sight of the screen, or the underlying reality.

All suffering comes from seeing two where there's one. When there's apparent separation, there's suffering. When there's oneness, there's just the one consciousness.

People will say ""but what about all this killing, war, and famine?"". War? Worry about the war within yourself. Nothing is happening outside of yourself, because you're all that exists.

As long as you love the world and are having fun experiencing apparent separation, you won't gravitate to spiritual things. When you're tired of playing the role of an individual, you'll return home like The Prodigal Son.

What's the harm in enjoying the world or returning to oneness? Nothing is happening. The one consciousness is having fun. This is all his divine lila or play.

Don't take anything seriously because like Paramahansa Yogananda said, the world is just ""dream images"".

This is the truth of all religions. Two becoming one. Losing your self (individual ego) in the infinite. This is also why the word yoga means ""union"".

It's nice to realize the truth and live it. It turns out, playing a role as someone you're not isn't always fun, and seems to take quite a bit of energy. When it gets exhausting... turn back toward your self.

The last few months, I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping. I go to sleep about 9:15, and fall asleep right away. But 5 or 6 nights per week, I will wake up somewhere around 1:30 or 2, mind racing, anxious, and unable to go back tosleep. Many nights, I'll end up just getting up about 3:30 after never getting back to sleep.

However, the past week or so, I've experimented with a new way of addressing this frustrating, almost nightly, experience. Instead of lying in bed trying to get back to sleep, if I wake up during the night, I pretty quickly get up, get my meditation pillow, and sit for about 20-30 minutes until I get pretty relaxed. Then, I try to hold that relaxation and get back into bed and continue meditating until I fall back asleep. It's worked for me 4 nights in a row.

That's some context for what I experienced last night, when I woke up about 1:14. I followed the same procedure I have been. Got up, drank some water, sat on pillow, did some breathing meditation, relaxed. At some point in that process, I started concentrating on dying. I kept breathing and just kind of let that thought sit there without judgment. It stayed with me until I got back into bed. At some point as I kind of started drifting into sleep, I would kind of come back into awareness and catch myself trying to (the best way I can explain it is) die through meditation. Like the sensation was that my sense of being was getting pulled into myself and out of the world. And when I'd become aware of it, I'd realize I was trying to push my being further and further ""inside"" myself and away from the world. And it felt like, I don't know really, but I'd guess I'd say it felt like dying and I was trying to will it to happen somehow. At some point I just feel asleep.

I woke up this morning in an absolutely horrible emotional state and I feel the worst I've felt in a long time. Probably for years since I first began practicing.

Is this a thing that anyone here has experience with or can help me understand? Is it something I should be concerned about, or just something to interrogate and accept as part of the ups and downs of practice?

I have found that I am most comfortable and balanced when I make slight modifications to traditional meditation seating postures. For example, rather than sitting in the traditional half lotus with my foot resting on my thigh, I find it more suitable to rest my foot just below my knee, with both lower legs stacked on top of one another, and I find it more suitable to have my foot closer to the back of my opposite knee in Burmese pose rather than aligned with my center.

It talks about how the brain is bombarded with information, and it would require so much energy to treat all, that by evolution it changed  the way it works. 

Basically, in order to preserve as much energy as possible, the brain works on a predictive model. Meaning the brain knows what it is supposed to be feeling smelling seeing and hearing, and so as long as nothing challenges that this is what you will feel see, etc.

Knowing that I now believe that is exactly what meditation is working on.

By the act of meditating, you are now actively choosing to challenge what your brain is feeding you the very active concentration is what makes the brain more active and so, of course, the way you view the world will change.

I was meditating and focusing on my breath when i got into a ""dream like state"" where i saw images pop up in my head as clear as a movie on a tv. At first, i saw a sillouhette of a human, with a white line around the sillouhete and the colours red and blue on the inside of the sillouhette.

Then...

I saw something that i won't  be able to describe with words well enough to do it justice. It was the most bueatiful thing i've seen in my 19 years of being on this planet, and it was created by my mind. 
 
It was a dark, enigmatic, elluring purple/blue colour ""being"" (feminine) with white hair and eyebrows. The colour of the ""being"" had a glow to it, almost neon. The eyes were the deepest blue i've ever seen, and i don't think i'll ever see colours as rich as those were. The hair and eyebrows were the purest white glow of the brightest white you could imagine. The ""being"" was making eye contact with me. I saw that image in my head for a split second, but i've never experienced anything like that in my life.

I want to ask, what is that dream like state? And most importantly, what was that ""being"" i saw in my mind?

1) Why I do body awareness, it's almost like I can't stop visualizing the body parts I'm supposed to be aware of, and I get lost in trying to control these ""visualizations""

Stoic Meditation: Stoicism, a school of philosophy founded in ancient Greece, emphasized practices aimed at developing inner tranquility and resilience in the face of life's challenges. Stoic meditation often involved reflection on the nature of reality, acceptance of things beyond one's control, and visualization of potential hardships to cultivate a sense of detachment and equanimity.  
  
Epicurean Reflection: Epicureanism, another Greek philosophical tradition, focused on attaining a state of inner peace and contentment through the pursuit of simple pleasures and the avoidance of unnecessary desires. Epicurean meditation might involve contemplation on the nature of pleasure, gratitude for life's simple joys, and reflection on the transience of material possessions.  
  
Pythagorean Contemplation: Followers of Pythagoras, an ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician, engaged in various contemplative practices aimed at purifying the soul and attaining spiritual insight. Pythagorean meditation could involve mathematical contemplations, symbolic interpretations of numbers, and introspective reflection on the harmony of the cosmos.  
  
Platonic Inquiry: Plato, one of the most influential philosophers in ancient Greece, advocated for philosophical inquiry as a means of attaining wisdom and self-awareness. Platonic meditation might involve dialectical reasoning, introspective questioning, and contemplation of abstract concepts such as justice, beauty, and the nature of the soul.

I’ve had a great flow during the past couple of days, and decided to write a follow up on the first part of my zen story. 

First of all i want to start off with explaining why i wont call any of my positive experiences around the topic of meditation for achievements because there are none. These are realizations. Everything that i am telling you, you already know. All of you. 

Needless to say that after my first experience when i realized that i didnt have any control over my thoughts or emotions i was baffled. It was the most mindblowing experience of my life. Can you imagine beeing so lost in your thoughts and emotions that you’ve been depressed for a good 15 years on and off, and then get this wonderful revelation presented for you, In the midst of total despair after a bad break up and a new possibility of drowning in your own head with all the anxiety that follows? 

When i look back on it, it all makes sense. I had to sink, not just below the surface. I had to hit rock bottom. This was the lowest point of my life by far. I had failed as a partner, and a father to my kids. I lost some of my closest friends, and i quit my job because i could’nt manage it any longer. What was I without all this external 
commotion that had occupied a good 90% of my awake time? But this time i didnt stay at the bottom. I used it as leverage and kicked back, and surfaced. 

This time around i knew something had changed in me. All of the emotions and and thoughts were the same. I looked the same when i checked in the mirror. But there was something different. And that was this gap. I was no longer IN my thoughts. I was WITH them. Huge difference. I was aware of my self in a way that i had never experienced before. It was like someone had turned on a flashlight in a pitch black room and all of a sudden i could see all of my bad traits and habbits presented for me. And boy was it dark. During the first couple of weeks i was light as a feather, i felt like i was on top of the world. But when you lift off the lid and truly begin to honestly look at yourself in the midst of daylight. Jeez. I was a fucking mess. Here’s a sample of traits and behaviours that i had collected and formed to habbits during the first part of my adult life; ( notes from my ”awakening” in january 2022)

Afraid all the time. 

People pleaser and putting myself second most of the time.

Anxiety/depressions

Comfort-eating 

Substance/alcohol abuse 

Stealing

Lying/White lies to keep up my persona.

Body shaming

Procrastination

Absent around my family

When i truly saw what i had become i hated my self again. Just like i’ve done so many times before, i went to that dark place in my head. I saw the spiral, i felt the habitual feelings of depression kicking in and i went back to that hell hole between my own ears. And like many times before i started feeling sorry for myself and sat up until very late and ate pretty much anything sugary i could get my hands on. 

The very next morning when i woke up i felt like shit. My stomach was aching from the night before and i really moody and had a severe headache. But at the same time i had this weird feeling inside of me. I kinda felt disgusted about how much i ate the night before and i had this gutfeeling telling me that i shouldnt eat that much. Naturally. Around the same time i had been reading alot about water fasting and decided to try it out for a few days. I had some broth freezer which i decided to have for lunch and dinner to help with the mood-swings from not getting normal meals. 

The first couple of days went fine, but when i reached the third day i felt like crap. I felt weak, fatigued and overall low. But as i sat down on that day on my meditation cushion in the morning something amazing happened. And bare in mind that i have never been spiritual in any way up to this point in my life. 
When i finished my morning meditation and got up i felt this warm, loving, hot ballopn in my stomach. Right in the area under my bellybutton ( This area is known as Hara in zen-buddhism and is a very important focus-point during zazen) 

And i could feel this warm caring love just pouring up inside of me. I felt every nerve connected to my spine just pulsating with electric energy and i had constant goosebumps for several hours. The craziest part of this story? This went on for 16 days. This was in the beging of the summer, and this was for me the summer of love. But ironically i was in love with my self. And the feeling was so strong that i couldnt deny it, even when my thoughts tried to tell me otherweise it was so undeniable that i truly loved myself and i always had. I cried teats of joy several times every day just from the pure relief of not having these horrible thoughts and feelings to constantly battle with. 

I hardly spoke to anyone during these days, i was so overwhelmed and amazed by the experience that i couldnt manage to go outside of myself. All the love i felt was not directed to anyone outside of me. It was all just for me. 

And it changed me forever. A few days after the feeling in my gut had disappeared i had a really bad day again. My girlfriend who i had recently broke up with, and who is the mother of my kids told me that she had started dating some new guy. And i was thrown into this same disaster/anxiety/darkness-thought patern that i was so familiar with. And i kinda saw how these thoughts led from one to another, and by the time i had gone really deep in my head with just pouring out hate, anger, guilt, resentment and sorrow i would just go in to this feeling that stated and justified my mental position ; depression. But this time it was a no go. I couldnt go there anymore. I tried again. No go. And i started laughing. I laughed so hard that i almost passed out. I punched the cushions on the sofa as hard as i could. I spazzed out completely because if it wasnt clear to me before it was now. There was no more depression. I had overcome my biggest obstacle in life. Myself. I was above surface and i was never going back down again.

This practice develops understanding, empathy, compassion and wisdom. It is a specific meditation in Buddhist practice. I have been teaching meditation for about 20 years now and currently teach in a psychiatric hospital where I occasionally use the Metta Bhavana as a practice. You may know this as simply 'loving kindness' where we wish for ourselves, our closest friends and family and others be 'free of suffering, freedom from worry, freedom of affliction and illness...' etc. When I do this at the hospital in the group activity therapy sessions I generally alter it so that there are not as many triggering statements. For example an important part of the meditation is to bring those you have had difficulty with and those that have harmed you into your consciousness and wish upon them those things (no suffering, no worry, no illness etc). I do not do this in those settings because some are in the hospital for trauma which can be quite recent and raw and this can be an undue and unwelcomed suffering they can experience again. I don't like that, and avoid pulling people into a traumatic thought loop.  
  
Secondly, some become uncomfortable in the meditation and leave. This can be for a myriad of reasons; from physical discomfort, sleepiness, calls to have a therapy visit, medications, and even being triggered by just having to think of the words 'suffering', and 'worry' among others.  
  
Sometimes, people have had some upset because they feel they cannot conjure up anyone they have affinity for. I start the meditation with the 'most cherished being', if that be animal or person, from the present or past, or even an imaginary being. I want to have them feel how easy it is to feel kindness towards some one. To wish upon someone they care for the 'non-suffering, non- worry, etc'. Not infrequently, people begin to cry as they think of those they love; children, spouses, exes, past pets, parents, etc.  
  
Having these feelings can indeed be overwhelming for many, especially in the mental healthcare setting.  
  
OK, so the question is; have you felt triggered by this meditation? Have you felt like leaving? How did you get through that?

I recently read ‘Mindfulness in Plain English’ and I’m a bit confused on Chapter 14: ‘Mindfulness versus Concentration’. 

It states that concentration and mindfulness are two different functions, the main goal of the Vipassana/insight meditation is to cultivate mindfulness. Concentration is one pointedness, forcing your mind to focus on one object. In this case, the breath. Mindfulness is the awareness that notices ‘distractions’ and brings back concentration to the breath. 

Now, the way I understood to meditate was just that. Sit, breathe, *concentrate* on your breath, and be *mindful* of any rising sensations or thoughts, and bring your awareness back to the breath. 

Where I’m confused is when it says ‘Put most of your effort into one pointedness at the beginning. Just keep calling the attention from wandering over and over again. Tough it out’ as a recommendation to beginners with the ‘monkey mind’. He then states that after a couple of months of developing concentration, to ‘start pumping your energy into mindfulness’. 

What does this mean exactly? How does one separately train mindfulness from concentration, Isn’t the act of calling the attention from wandering mindfulness in itself? Does he mean at the beginning to maintain ‘one pointedness’ on the breath, and after developing concentration skills for a while, perhaps moving on to mindfully interacting and observing rising thoughts and sensations instead of anchoring yourself to the breath? Am I getting this right?

Thanks in advance! Happy to learn and grow.

I read this thing about meditating with my chakras but my thing is, i don’t understand how to do that. 

Here is the thing i read

“Here, you are to move through each of the main seven chakras in order to support their opening, and the connection of your Soul to each area of your physical energy. Feel into each centre, focusing on the area containing each chakra, one at a time, beginning at your root chakra and working up to your crown chakra. Ask yourself this at each point; what do I see? What do I hear? What do I feel? This will connect you more deeply with your body. Focus on each chakra for 3-5 minutes, for a total of 20-35 minutes, depending on how much time you have on any given morning.”

The thing i am stuck on is asking my self for each chakra, what do I see? What do I hear? What do I feel? Is confusing for me. What am i supposed to see, what am i supposed to hear? What am i supposed to feel? The feeling part is especially confusing for me.

Then, I thought I saw a shadow walk in front of me but I didn't break my concentration and kept my eyes closed. Suddenly I could see, without opening my eyes. I saw the whole garden I was meditating in as if my eyes were open. 

There was a person standing in front of me. I experienced this whole thing through both my own eyes and the eyes of the person in front of me. I recognized the person and it was myself. Meditating-me asked: ""Who are you?"", and standing-me replied with: ""I am you."" and standing-me reached out and handed me a white flower.

I experienced all of this from both perspectives at the same time and I felt comfortable and safe. The moment I gave myself the white flower there was a bell that signalled the end of my meditation.

I've been curious about Transcendental Meditation (TM) for a while now, and I've been hearing mixed opinions about it. Some say it's a life-changing practice that brings huge benefits, while others label it as a scam. Is it necessary to pay for a teacher?

I'm intrigued by the reported benefits of TM, but I'm hesitant to invest $800 without a clearer understanding. Those who have paid for TM, could you share your experiences? Did you find it worthwhile? Did you feel like you got value for your money? And most importantly, did you achieve the results that were promised?

On the other hand, for those who have learned TM on their own or through alternative means, how did that experience compare? Do you think it’s just as effective?

Other thoughts come in and I get distracted, I eventually realize I've gotten lost in thought so I return my focus to my breath...rinse and repeat.

The problem I'm having is that lately the stuff distracting me is extremely emotionally charged. I meditate...I focus on my breath...now I'm in my bedroom as a child and my mother is singing me a bedtime song (my mother and I have become estranged so this isn't comforting but deeply sad for me and also very uncomfortable due to the mixed feelings). Okay, I have gotten distracted. I bring my focus back to my breath.

Breathe a few times, okay I'm doing good. Suddenly, I'm back in highschool in line at the cafeteria but I'm the shortest kid in the school and everyone keeps pushing their way past me so I go hungry for lunch because they're out of food by the time I finally make it to the front. Now I'm angry about how a school could dare to serve students lunch and not supply enough food to actually feed everyone. Okay, I have gotten distracted. I return my focus to my breath. Now I'm still wanting to cry from earlier and I'm pissed off.

You can surely find a spare room somewhere for the child who defeated your all time greatest enemy? No? Okay then but yeah I've gotten distracted. Breathe. Focus on the breath.

This hamster wheel keeps going in circles and I keep getting triggered by the things my mind throws at me and it's without adequate time for me to calm down in between events.

So instead of feeling rested, relaxed or at peace...I feel angry, sad, even distraught or traumatized. I keep going and wait patiently hoping this will ease up but it doesn't and I end up so upset that I eventually jolt up and am forced to stop.

I feel like the only thing I'm learning here is that I am a prisoner of a mind that tortures me when I try to relax.

This is my first time ever posting anything on reddit. I’ve never been much of a sharer when it comes to my own experiences in any topic at all, but ive been reading r/meditation quite alot lately and thought that my experiences with meditation could be valuable to share with some of the members. 

Starting off with some background info about myself. I am a normal guy with a normal job, 37 years old and i was 34 when i started doing meditations. I’ve been struggling with my mental health for the biggest part of my adult life due to undiagnosed ADHD aswell as unresolved past traumas that left me with severe depressions and PTSD.  I’ve always had an introverted side of me, and i had never earlier in my life learned how to open up and talk about my feelings or even communicate around my past nor present experiences which basically made me behave like a human pressure cooker. I held everything inside until the pressure got to me and i would explode in someones face. Many of these past conditions made me very self-concious in a very negative way, and the only escapes that i had from my own thoughts and feelings was either drugs, alcohol, over consuming food or porn. 

Just to make things even easier for me i got into a relationship when i was 30, and we had a beautiful baby daughter about a year later. And we bought a house. First things first. Right? As i mentioned earlier i did have problems with both addictions and mental issues, but i still functioned to a sertain extent and managed to hold a full time job and still managed to keep my ”surface-life” intact. I worked out, kept doing renovations on the house we lived in and life was pretty descent. After all, i didnt know of anything else, or any other mental state since i’ve been on and off with depressions since my early 20’s. The wet blanket that clouded my judgement and humor was just a part of me. 

Then Covid hit. And when i couldnt run away from my problems any more, and all the restrictions made it practically impossible to maintain a workout schedule nor a social life my mental health plumited and so did my family. We’ve always been struggling with our daughter who has been diagnosed with autism and adhd and with constant diseases, poor economy and all of the social restrictions we had a really hard time getting by during the lockdown-years. And by the end of 2021 it got even worse for me, and i finally crashed mentally. I couldnt hold my job anymore, i was mentally a wreck and barely managed to get my panta on the right way in the morning. And when i thought that it couldnt get any worse, my girlfriend broke up with me. This left me in a state of total despair. I have never felt so broken down in my whole life. I wasnt just under the surface, I was literally on the bottom. 

Luckily for me i had some very supportive friends at the time, and we used to go for long walks and i slowly started to open up about my mental conditions and also went to therapy for a while, which was great and pretty eye-opening in some aspects. We also did a bit of shrooms and acid that also helped me to get over alot of anxiety over sertain things. And this was when the shit literally hit the fan again. 

I got a bit over confident with shrooms one night with a couple of friends. At the particular evening i wasnt feeling all that well, the last weeks had been kind of hectic and i was quite exhausted. But since it was my weekend without kids i wasnt gona waste it and made a poor decision and downed about 8 grams of dried mushrooms on a empty stomach and finished them off with a couple of hits from a joint ( i used to be a regular smoker but at the time i’d been off from cannabis for about two years) I have some vague memories from that evening, but the stuff i do remember is like from a horrormovie. It was like a dream-state where i couldnt control my actions and i think i acted out alot of horrible stuff from my sub-concious mind that i had stored for years. By the end of the evening i was totally sure that i was dead. When i finally came down from the trip my friends looked horrified. They were on shrooms aswell that evening and had ran off from the house because they got scared of me. One of the guys still doesnt want to talk to me to this day. 

After this experience i knew that something in me really had to change. I didnt know at the time what it was, but something had to be done. My whole inner being was in uproar and i knew that i couldnt keep it up for much longer before my life would turn for worse again. The month after that incident was horrific in so many ways but the possitive side was that everything was not about me anymore, i had to move out of my own head and be less self-concious since i had so many things to work out in my social/family life after that incident. 

I really didnt feel like numbing myself anymore, and i couldnt find a mental relief in going to the gym. So one day i was talking to a friend who just had done a beginners course in zen-meditation. And it got me interested and i decided to try meditation for myself. And by a beautiful coincidence i had for the first time in my life started to exercise disciplin in different aspects of my daily rutines. 

So i did 15 mins of meditation every morning, and 15-30 mins in the evening before bedtime. It was so hard for me. My body wanted to move all the time. My thoughts kept screaming at me; ”This is a waste of time! Dont you got anything else to do?! You have kids! Who do you think you are?! Ghandi? This is ridiculous!” Etc. And sometimes i moved. Or opened my eyes. Even started crying. And occasionally it was really pleasant. But i was determined and kept on practicing, even though i didnt really know why. Just a gut feeling i guess. 

A couple of months later i had a horrible morning. I felt like shit right from the start when i got out off bed. I was moody, sensitive and feeling lonely and anxious. I tried to talk my way out of my morning meditation that i had been doing for almost 60 days straight. -”Cmon. Can we just get the day started. Dont feel like doing this crap today. Its of no use anyway”

But disciplin kicked in. And i sat down on my cushion, did my 15 mins and went on with my morning. After the meditation my emotions and thoughts settled in a weird way and i noticed that it was awfully quite inside. And as i thought about it i noticed that the thought, that i just had thought was no longer inside of my head. It was kind of like a cloud, passing rapidly on a clear sky. One moment it was there, and the next it was gone. 

This experience made me tremble. It was like someone had turned on the lights. The feeling i had was something inbetween nausea and bliss. It wasnt all pleasant nor was it horrible. But i knew something. I felt it deep to the core of my beeing. And after contemplating it for an hour or so i finally understood. I am not my thoughts, and i do not control them. Thoughts make me feel certain ways but my feelings, just as my thoughts are not me. They are just passing by all time, and i am the one who experiences them. There had suddenly appeared a gap between me and thoughts/emotions. And i understood that everything that i had been thinking about myself for my entire life was not true any more. I was free!

I always knew that meditating was good for me but didn't really understand its true benefits. 

At first, I started meditating in an effort to relieve my anxiety in anxious moments so my schedule was dependent on whenever my anxiety was the highest, so it was temporary relief. Then my motivation changed and I really wanted to prioritize it in my life more and built it into my schedule- not depending on when I was anxious but more so at the same time every single day, whether I was anxious or not- 9:30am. Then I actually started to DREAD meditating! I wasn't looking forward to it because it was disciplined and hard work! That's when I knew I was getting somewhere with it!

THIS is the key. Because I changed my mindset from 'anxiety relief' to habit and disciplined- similar to going to the gym, then that's when I really started to see the true benefits of the practice. and it a PRACTICE.

I’ve recently started meditating again after a few years of non practice.

I’ve been using Pema Chodron’s ‘How to Meditate’ as a sort of refresher guide. In this course she teaches open eye meditation and focusing on the object of breath. 

I’ve found it very helpful and quite different to the old way I used to meditate which was with closed eyes, almost searching for a ‘letting go’ TM style. 

This open eye practice seems more instructive at the moment for me. 

Since the last few days, off the mat - I’ve been carrying this deep seated feeling - I could describe it maybe like loneliness without sadness. A longing. It’s a heavy feeling. 

I wonder has anyone here can recall if you felt something similar either beginning or returning to meditation and if the feeling developed or went away for you- I’m hoping it might lead to greater insight but it also feels like it could potentially lead to depression. It’s kind of an overwhelming sort of cloak. 

I wish you the best in your journey. Take care.

So I had a brain aneurysm on September 23/23.  
  
Ever since then I developed PTSD and currently am in trauma therapy and actually started meditation in December (prior to discovering the ptsd - panic, aniexty, intrusive thoughts, etc).  
  
I meditate daily up to 60 min per day over 2-3 sessions.   
  
Today's sent me into panic, I'm better now after doing some slight reading but wanted to share my story!  
  
I've been doing keto for 2 weeks now after reading chris Palmers book about the link between food - brain. So because I'm still hating trauma, some things still set me off and send me to fight or flight. I'm still managing to get my electroytes to a perfect level and felt a bit off this morning so ate my hemp hearts and a Avocado to up my potassium then proceed to meditate.   
  
Within 5 minutes I had a sensation like no other. I felt like I was 1000 lb and could not move but it felt so AMAZING. Only thing I can compare it to is a high THC gummy body buzz (although I quit all that stuff months ago). It was intense, my wife who came to tell me the radio guy was here in regards to our new ad campaign for our business didn't know I wag meditating and woke me. I could barely speak, and this intense heaviness then sent me into panic thinking I'm possibly having a potassium overdose or something in that regard.   
  
I have along way to go, but from what I'm reading this intense feeling is a good thing. Although in my current state it scared me so much.   
  
I'm really loving the peace of mind meditating brings my body and soul and will continue on. I started with 5 min sessions and so far my longest ever was 40 min 🙃.

I used to experiment with weed when I was younger, and sometimes would get extreme anxiety // panic attacks when I started to face this feeling of derealization. I would feel like I was dreaming, and start to panic, as if I was going to lose control, and lose grip of reality. I've learned that I'm not one to relinquish control.

I'd like to change that.

At times, when I meditate, I find myself in a strange headspace. I can only describe it as things feel a bit like they're warping. I get this sensation that, say, if im sitting cross legged with my hands together on my lap, that my hands are floating up to my face.

I'll then get to this threshold where I feel that I'm going to cross over something. I don't know how to explain it, or what it is that I'm crossing over in to, but I feel a fear. It feels like I will completely lose grip of reality if I allow myself to move past that thing, whatever it is. I'm really not doing it justice, trying to explain it. But it's the same panic I used to feel when smoking marajuana. I get that feeling of ""shit, im going in too deep"" and then pull myself out of the meditation. I'm wondering if that fear is something inside myself related to desperately clinging to control that I'm supposed to just learn to face.

What is this sensation? Has anyone else experienced it? If so, what happened when you pushed past it? Am I going to literally start having a psychedelic trip if I let myself go over that threshold? How can I learn to let go?

Another aspect of meditation that feels like a superpower I would like to point out is how rare and useful it is to tap into mindfulness mode on command. Using mindfulness to get my head out of the cloud helps me as a student. 

But there's more to superpowers than survival. As a child, we all dreamed of having supernatural abilities like invisibility, flight, super strength, super speed, because we thought it'd make our lives easier and it'd separate us from most people, making us special. However, doesn't mindfulness—the ability of staying in the present—already does those things? Not everyone can make the most out of the present. Some people go to concerts, weddings, birthdays, and other events, but can't fully enjoy it because they were either thinking of the past or the future.

The fearful thoughts in our brain are driven by dopamine (and adrenaline), it is this hormone that moves, drives, compells us to do anything. So when you only observe these thoughts and emotions you keep used to it, so it stops releasing dopamine, so the brain just keeps looking for other fearful thoughts to keep that dopamine spiking, and thus compelling us to act. If there is no dopamine spike, it mean total lack of motion.
And lack of motion means, no dopamine. It's a closed loop. The goal of our natural programming is to keep us going, to keep that dopamine spiking which in turns generates more motion. I guess it really is what it is, there is no free will.

I discovered my old notes from 2014, where I had listed resolutions for the person I wanted to be. It was about my life in general: health, relationships, career, hobbies.. It was the only time I'd ever made a resolution board, and honestly, I didn't do anything with it. I just put my thoughts on paper. But yesterday, when I looked at those notes, I was amazed by how much I've already achieved.

I'm not talking about massive success, it's the small things, like carving out time for my hobbies, having a small family of my own, a garden to enjoy our late dinners in, a steady exercising routine.

So I was truly inspired by how far I've come. Yet at the same time I couldn't shake off this feeling of sadness, because I hardly ever looked back to even notice it.

I often feel like I'm not doing enough and that I should try harder, optimize more, and grow faster. It's never enough, and always needs to be better. Yet, here I am, actually making it happen. Not fully, but quite visibly. I am growing, but these changes are hard to see in the day-to-day grind.

So it was a moment of inspiration for me and reminded me how important it is to look back more often, to celebrate what I've done and not get stuck with what I still would like to do.

I could see it out of the corner of my eye and my immediate thought was: “oh gosh I hope I don’t have a chin hair sticking out or look gross from this angle. Shit he can probably see so many things I’d rather him not see…” 🫤

I immediately noticed the pain attached to the thoughts and went into observer mode (where I simply listen and notice what’s going on inside vs experiencing it like I just was). 

💡Once I entered this observer state, I realized that these thoughts were rooted in a subconscious belief that I needed to change my body (or anything really) to be acceptable or loveable.

I used to think to myself - if someone can have the most beautiful woman and she can be wise, nurturing, intelligent, then there’s no need for me 😔. <——— THIS IS THE CULPRIT TRIGGERING THESE FEELINGS!

❌ But WOW was I so wrong! ❌ And this moment of presence just helped me see it with divine clarity!

As I write this my heart is wanting to burst with joy because I see it all so clearly and if this is how you feel, I want you to see it too!! 

💡Because here’s what I also know: by being aware of the programs or beliefs that attract these types of thoughts or feelings of insecurity, I then have the power to change them! So that’s what I did. This feeling of joy blooming in my chest as I witness this painful inner experience is happening because I know I’m on the precipice of FREEDOM from a pain that has burdened me my whole life…🥹🥹🥹

I realized that in this moment of clarity I didn’t agree with this narrative anymore and haven’t for a long time. But it’s been living on repeat deep in my subconscious from ALL of the times I believed it to be true. From all the times I looked at myself as if I’m something unacceptable because I don’t have perfect skin or a flat stomach.

Now I have an opportunity to change this belief because I’m aware of it! That’s exactly what happened — while in this moment of clarity, I received a NEW, productive, generous perspective about my body insecurities…

I realized that the things I feel insecure about or hate myself for or the flaws I see on my skin, my shortcomings…they’re not reasons for someone to not choose me. They’re not even reasons to feel ugly or less than!!!! That has just been one way of looking at them and thankfully, our sustained attention is what creates facts for our lives.

They’re 🌤️ opportunities for me and whoever is with me to choose love! They’re not the easiest things to love at all but I believe that’s the point! Every time I decide to love them, something expands in my chest and my body rewards me with something words can’t express! 

Every time I choose to love someone and their shortcomings, every time I choose to accept them as they are and still love them (I still have firm boundaries between us tho 😼), I can’t help but feel LIFTED. I feel ACTIVATED! This light inside gets turned up another notch and I think THAT is the point!

This is the medicinal feeling of UNCONDITIONAL LOVE and it came to me from a moment of presence. From a moment of choosing to understand myself and witness myself with compassion. From a moment of choosing to love myself by not entertaining the negative thoughts. 

And the same is possible for you. Give it a try. Tune in and notice with the intent to protect yourself. With the intent to love yourself no matter what. That love we seek from others is all within us. And once we tap into it, others can’t help but reflect it or let us go if they can’t.

He doesn't understand my autism and had made no attempts to see the struggles it causes. Especially for burnout and exacerbating ocd flares

I know on the surface it's a good thing but in practice it becomes draining and depressing. My Dad used to drink and smoke alot but now never does drinking nor smoking. He may have the casual beer after a hard day of work but it's only one.

Now he spends his free time watching ""self improvement"" videos with people like Jocko Willinks and Tony Robbins and James Clear (Atomic Habits). Holding what they say is true due to hearing it from other successful people who made alot of money. He Believes in self discipline and ""happiness is in the mind"" type mindsets. He told me today to ""get out of my comfort zone"" and push yourself because ""I'm not even trying"".

For a while I did so too. I pushed myself alot trying to get a degree in computer science and then working full time in retail during summer breaks. But the anger and mental torment I got from pushing myself wore me down. Plus I had a streak of bad luck with prof teachers and was constantly stressed about passing 24/7. Ontop of that I had lazy roommates who were passive aggressive and touched my stuff while I was gone. I knew I should have said something bug I felt like there would be tension and I had enough of it.

Chronically anxious made me depress and it caused me severe burnout. I felt drained and dragging my feet trying to finish classes. I was mad and pissed off at the unfair circumstances I was in.

The work I did at the moment made no impact because now I have moved back in with my Dad who is a severe workaholic and is Disappointed by my lack of effort to even get out of bed at a reasonable time. I wake up so sad and I feel like he never understands why I'm so pessimistic.

I live in Canada where the economy is in shambles and buying a house seems like a ""pie I the sky"" sort of deal. I want to have goals but the OCD and depression make each day a drain as I wake up and do stuff then immediately feel like sleeping again.

I have a psychiatrist but they don't understand ocd and just hope the pills will work. I'm on 100 mg of zoloft, 50mg of regular seroquel in the day, 100mg of seroquel xr at night and 1mg of klonopin daily.

I try to help my Dad but then he always ""moves the goal post"" and gives criticism to my flaws then acknowledging all the work I do for him. Like yesterday I helped him out in the yard for 4 hours. But today I had to do homework so he complains I didn't help him at all today and ignores yesterday. Never grateful for what I do to help him.

He yells alot and ""tells me to fuck off"" which he says he doesn't mean it after. But it hurts when he yells and keeps going off. I even don't like bringing stuff up as he goes on and on about stuff. Good or bad. He just talks my ear off. If I don't do what he says and give him reasons he sees them as excuse and yells at me. Even him saying he's ""talking nicely"" is condensing and is out to judge me and make me feel guilty.

Just tonight I asked if I could quickly brush my teeth and he told me to ""fuck off"" because I was using up his time. He has only an hour of free time before going to bed and can't waste five minutes to let me brush my teeth as I get too tires after watching the show. So he yells and makes me feel bad. He doesn't even stay up the whole time we were watching the show so that's annoying.

I try to love him but his working attitude is insane. He goes to bed at 12am and wakes uo around 4am to either go to work which is an hour drive there and an hour drive back. Or he's doing paperwork. He complains that he hates it but ""life is 80 percent bullshit and 20 percent fun"". Which makes me even more pessimistic. I feel tired just listening to him about it. Even other topics as he goes on and on talking. Just doesn't know when to shut up.

My mom is not better. If I miss a day of my retail job due to ocd flare she tells me to ""suck it up and go to work"". She's a whole new can of worms but both have done their part to ruin my development.

But recently I’ve been doing some research and heard from people that observing thoughts is not good, someone even said it can be dangerous in the long run and can make you go crazy if you don’t have a guided master that can help you. I guess this is because emotions that is attached to these thoughts “energy” can fuel these thoughts if you just observe them, and can lead you to going “crazy”. Instea, they claim to find the “source of the thoughts”. I’m new to mediating and this makes me pretty anxious cause whenever I observe my thoughts I feel like I’m doing everything wrong all of a sudden. 

How are one supposed to deal with anxiety thoughts rising? Someone said “ignore them” but that sounds like pushing them away to me. 

Please help me, because spiritual guides like Eckhart Tolle made me get into mediation and observing thoughts is a huge part of his education.

True meditational practice is not watching thoughts or breathes it is focusing your attention inwards. When you watch thoughts you focus your attention behind the eyes and when you watch your breathe it is mostly breast and the belly but also (later on) includes the nasal region.

So simply go for exercises that move the focus of your attention thoughout your body and you will have a way better meditational experience.

I don’t  know if it’s because I’m getting older and the thought of growing up and being on my own is setting in. I’m trying everything to help me but I have so many questions. I’ve tried to believe in God but I can’t understand how the people control this world would allow people to find the “truth” if it’s true. (I’m talking about Christianity) I’ve tried Buddhism but they believe that the only to end this endless cycle of”suffering” is to reach enlightenment and cease to exist. I don’t believe that. I want to believe that I was born for a reason and that my life has purpose. Maybe it’s just me wanting to believe all of this isn’t for nothing but hey 🤷‍♀️.

I’ve also gotten into reality shifting. I’m the type of person to want adventure, I also watch anime. Anime worlds seem so fun, they have magic, adventure, friendship, action, romance, etc, but here we don’t have any of those, hence why I am always bored all the time. This boredom has convinced me to create my own webcomic. 

But anyways, let’s get back on topic. I’ve tried multiple things, such as religion, manifestation, meditation, prayer, etc but I’m still stressed. I’ve even gained derealization, and it’s so scary.

My answers have evolved significantly over the years.

In the past, I often associated my purpose with a future goal I wanted to achieve. At that time, I believed that discovering my purpose meant finding strategies and tools to accomplish my goals. However, my perspective changed when I stumbled upon a quote that said, “**Living purposefully is about living mindfully and intentionally.**” This realization made me understand that our purpose isn’t in the future; it’s in the here and now. When we live in the moment and make the best of each moment, things usually unfold in amazing ways.

So nowadays, when people ask me how to find their life purpose, my answer is simply to do what’s in front of you with all your heart and effort. When you become mindful in your day-to-day life, you automatically feel a deep sense of meaning and purpose.

Besides living mindfully, I believe **living purposefully is also about living authentically.** When we express a desire to find our life purpose, what we’re truly seeking is to discover our truest and most authentic selves. When we have crystal-clear clarity on who we are, what we value, what we’re good at, and what lights us up, we naturally move onto the path that’s most aligned with our purpose.

How do you find your authentic self? The best question you can ask yourself is, “What feels natural to me?” No judgments or people-pleasing, no second-guessing or self-criticism — just feelings of engagement and enjoyment. Whenever you feel natural and genuine, you are headed in the right direction.

A passage from a book I’ve been reading this week resonates with this: “Your ultimate goal in life should be to simply enjoy your existence, to pursue the things that make you happy, to discover your truest self, to honor who you are, and from that place of authenticity, create the most beautiful things. To develop an unwavering love for your life, and through that, plant seeds of inspiration in all the people you encounter.”

Interested to have a discussion here. I understand mindfulness is often about getting out your own head and feeling through your emotions, feeling the body and releasing tension etc.

As much as I try to do this, when I feel a little stressed, anxious about things, I often feel the need to speak to myself, give myself advice and ‘talk my way’ out of my mental barriers I’ve given myself

The ego and mind is always looping the past and worry for the future. A very destructive loop whatever it is the ego’s looping. It’s only in the present moment you consciously can choose where your focus is. But sometimes when mind is too tangle up with thoughts and you need help calming them down to find your center, and change your state of mind, I find help in mindfully listen to beautiful music. Not doing anything special, just listen with headphones, and keep my focus at the beauty that fills my void inside. It slows everything down and make me more capable of being mindful again.

I’ve never really had a moment to myself. On top of working, I’ve been in about 5 relationships- the longest one (a few days from a year) ending in flames (this happened 3 years ago almost to the dot). I blamed her, I blamed my parents for my lack of friends, I blamed God for this shitty situation. 

As a behavior to protect myself, I went to the gym to spite everybody. I worked out 6 days a week. I gained 25lbs of muscle mass in 8 months. I crashed and burned. Harder this time. I started partying almost every single night, abusing alcohol like it owed me money (which in hindsight, it kinda does because of how much I spent LOL jk). After 6 months of that, I found out my parents and I were moving to a rural town outside the city. The move made me start resenting them and I caused a lot of heartache. I quit my job (now 45 mins away instead of 15) and got a new job in town (5 mins away). 

A year and a half goes by (about 6 months ago), and I genuinely started working on repairing the relationships I had broken or made worse than they were. I started genuinely healing. I was reading self help and nonfiction books in my spare time. January of this year I started the 75 hard program. I was consistent. No one could stop me. After 30 days, A shoulder injury broke those plans.

In February, I relapsed and hit alcohol hard again. 3 drinks every single night for almost 3 weeks. I recognized the problem. I quit cold turkey.

A week into withdrawals, my mind was basically always thinking of other things than being here. I had struggled with DPDR before, but not like now. This time, I was in a constant battle with myself. I was battling the worst thoughts I’d ever had and even my parents looked like monsters. I couldn’t recognize their love. Instead of feeling loved, I felt scared. I found out, it wasn’t my intentional thoughts. It was the immense fear of becoming what the thoughts were. I was so scared of becoming what “my” thoughts were showing me that I couldn’t focus on anything and would have panic attacks that lasted an hour. 

I felt like I was losing my mind or having a psychotic break or something. After a week, I sat down and tried meditating and speaking with God by my side (I’m not gonna shove this down your throat, I just want you to know what my thoughts are and what I believe. Choose or don’t choose to believe this). Immediately, the bad thoughts went away. The meditation helped more than enough. Mindfulness started working. 

It’s (DPDR) come back a few times, but I’m telling you guys mindfulness has helped me immensely with gauging what’s really my thoughts and gauging what’s real. I almost lost so much touch with reality that my mind almost broke me. If anyone has a question about if mindfulness works or not, it does.

\~ Epictetus, Enchiridion (XXXV.)

Every action we do is under our responsibility. Whether we choose to act one way or the other, is completely under our own discretion. Therefore, what we choose to do, based on our foresight, should be conducted with clear judgement and with the intention of it being the right, just, and truthful action itself.

Recently, I talked about how Agrippinus defied Nero’s invitation to a get-together simply because he knew that attending was not right and would go against his values. But even after being questioned, he didn’t cave in to the pressure; he remained stern.

He wasn’t afraid of doing the action because he knew he was right - even when Florus, a Roman official, misunderstood and questioned his perspective. He didn’t fear the disapproval because that’s what was true to his self.

And that’s how we should act as well: Acting to the point where, with enough practice, we know it’s the right thing to do based on the alignment with our virtues, and to not back away from that position; to ensure that our actions are not wrong, unjust, and untruthful.

“But what do we do if we perform actions that are wrong, unjust, and untruthful?”

Shun the action itself.

Like many other meditation/mindfulness practices, it talks about 'letting go' of things as you become more mindful. Of thoughts, of things beyond your control, of ideas and so on.

My question is a bit basic and silly: how does one 'let go' while still making an effort to take action? For instance, if one wants to try hard to make a long distance relationship work, or try relentlessly to get a well paying job when you have to pay off a loan? How does one prevent inaction in the process of 'letting go'?

Is it that you just let go of the end goal and focus on your actions? But then, how does one get motivation for the effort?

So I'm just wondering if there's any specific advice or resources for bringing mindfulness to tap into desire, as in INCREASE it, or RELEASE it, because so much turning up on Google is about overcoming it and quieting it.

Those familiar with my work will often see me mention various “Crucial Factors” pertaining to the efficiency and productivity of an Individuals Process of Awakening and Self-Initiation into life’s many mysteries… With that said, here I will describe and present yet another one of these highly essential factors…. I call this one “Attitude Towards the Experience” (A. T .T .E).

This is one aspect of the process, which has a direct and very significant effect upon the Overall quality of an Individuals experience… as well as upon their ability to get the most out of any given situation, no matter how seemingly fruitless or mundane the circumstance may be…

Navigating the current system that is in play, can very easily become discouraging in many ways if one does not make the necessary adjustments within their everyday lives… perhaps even especially for the Awakening Individual who can begin to see just how far the endless suppression and control of knowledge and life in general, has truly gone.

Though, with this ever-growing Awareness and In-depth perspective on such incredibly rare areas of life, comes a very real responsibility, you might even say a Necessity, for the Individual at hand to Apply and Integrate these rare insights into the different areas of their lives and conduct, in a healthy and beneficial way… as opposed to letting them drive one to any variety of unstable and unbeneficial mental states/Conditions (Depression, Anxiety, Fear, Paranoia etc.)… which is something I have seen all too often.

After one’s idea of “Reality” is shattered, which is an absolute must on the path of Awakening… it is then Important to Assimilate this deepened Perspective… One must begin to rebuild and reprogram their daily conduct, Attention and decision making, in accordance with these various degrees of Insight… and do so in a manner which reflects a Passionate and Inspired Outlook towards the process… even within all the darkness and chaos which surrounds the present age… in the sense that “we have now identified the issue and can begin to transmute this into growth, through proper Thought and Action.”

For the freshly awakening Individual, who is in the midst of their first in-depth assessments of the “state of the world”, it is quite easy to feel overwhelmed by this energy of suppression and deceit which governs so efficiently a society, which at first glance, screams “Lost Cause” … However, it is important for one to realize that despite the Mass Ignorance and Lack of Awareness… despite the unbelievable depth of the Corruption and Deceit… those Individuals who are capable of coming to these In-depth realizations, hold the potential to play a hugely significant role… you could even say a “Divinely Significant” role towards ushering in the New Age and bringing the Collective into a much more Efficient and Spiritually Aware state of Existence…

One who finds themselves in this rare position, will soon realize the Intimate and fascinating relationship between their Internal Nature, and the World around them… As Above, So Below… As Within, so Without… Ones Experience is a direct product of their own Internal Conditions(Spiritual and Psychological) whether they be perspectives, attitudes, emotions, habits, addictions, depression, anxiety, pessimism or any other of a wide range of Internal phenomena… therefor when an Individual begins to embody this deepened perspective and Increased co-creative potential, they will being to see more and more of that which they regularly give their energy and attention to, expressed outward in their daily experience… the Internal, reflected outwards, with Intimate and precise fashion.

Attention and Efforttowards any particular Emotion, Internal Condition, Thought, perspective etc., attracts and yields direct experiences which are of like resonance… The Individual who is susceptible to depression, actively feeds, encourages and brings forth like-phenomena into their lives when they give in to it… and the same goes for all different manner of Influence and energetic resonance, at both ends of the spectrum… One with a natural (spiritual and mental) resilience to outside influence has a great advantage in this area.

It is Important for one to not spend time dwelling upon “in the wrong light”, the endless nonsense which surrounds them… no matter how downright flabbergasting it might be at times… it is important to not “Take offence” to this deepened perspective into the majority of the worlds Ignorant state of being… but to instead carefully observe, analyze and Integrate the many present Insights pertaining to how and why this lack of awareness has come about, its wide variety of manifestations within everyday life and how they can begin to participate in the deceptive tactics as little as possible within their own behavior.

The degree of an Individuals “Presence of Mind” within any given moment, greatly determines their amount self-control and Awareness of their own Conduct… as well as their ability to extract Knowledge and Insight from within any given Experience/Circumstance. Therefor the Individual who embodies an unsavory attitude and deminer towards their daily lives, and who is highly susceptible in nature to outside Influence, misses out on endless Insight and opportunity… simply because they do not believe or even consider, that it could possibly be present within such a mundane existence… and is thus living a much less in-depth and lower quality of life, as compared to the Awakening Individual who is constantly looking for opportunities towards growth and development within every situation… even within mundane social Interactions and the chaotic work flow… keeping an optimistic outlook towards the experience as a whole, hardships and ALL…

Every Sentient being… especially One who finds themselves on a dedicated path of awakening, should view their overall experience of life, as if it were the absolute most Intimate and Important Relationship of which they will ever take part in… and indeed it should be... this relationship should take priority, for it is the source and cause behind all else that they will perceive in this life.

Bond with this Experience… with its darknessand its light… show it Love, Compassion, Patience and Genuine Effort, and this will Indeed make its way into being reciprocated within ones life… However, treat it with dread, doubt and neglect… then this too will be reciprocated.

Much Love

In every single situation you experience, what do you value and prioritize?

Here's a good story that should set a standard:

Nero was the infamous 5th Roman Emperor who was known for being extraneously violent and homicidal. It was publicly known that refusing Nero’s orders would most definitely get you murdered or tortured. Agrippinus was a Stoic philosopher who was highly regarded by Epictetus.

One day, Nero held an event for all and Agrippinus declined his attendance.

Florus, a Roman official, knew that not attending meant death. He even said: “But if I do not act a part, I shall lose my head.” Agrippinus simply responded: “Go and act it then, but I will not.” and outlined his duty to not conform and instead, to being the singular purple thread amongst the many white threads in a robe.

Agrippinus knew what he valued and knew that the value of living honourably was more valuable than living itself. That’s not to say that dying is preferable to living, even Agrippinus said that it’s not; however, the virtues are guides to what we must follow regardless of the circumstance, at all times.

The next time you are faced with a situation that may jeopardize the practice of your values, remember Aggripinus’ story and ask yourself: What do you truly value? What do you sell yourself at?

Don’t sell yourself short.

938,Mindfulness,traceyzhang,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7da6fdda3190>,1711822338.0,True,t3_1broahh,6,/r/Mindfulness/comments/1broahh/how_to_accept_the_things_you_can_not_change/,27,"I recently stumbled upon a quote from a book that resonated deeply: “To live a good life, all you need are three elements: the serenity to accept things you can’t change; the courage to change the things you can; and the wisdom to know the difference.” Reflecting on this, I personally find that among these elements, the most challenging is acceptance.

In the past, I saw acceptance as passivity, a form of giving up. I worried that once we accept things, they become unchangeable. However, the truth is often the opposite. The moment we begin to accept is precisely when things start to shift.

An insight from a book has helped me grasp this concept. The author explains it simply: “For example, if you’re sick, it’s about recognizing that you’re sick, accepting you’re not at full capacity, giving yourself permission to slow down in order to heal, and asking for help when you need it rather than powering through.”

Acceptance allows us to proactively decide our next steps with clarity, compassion, and a degree of ease. It is the first step towards any transformation.

So, how do we cultivate acceptance and hone this skill? Through my own experiences, I’ve distilled three key practices:

**1 Through Radical Honesty**

Acceptance begins with unwavering honesty — both with ourselves and others. Often, our struggles with acceptance stem from our reluctance to confront the full spectrum of truth. By bravely acknowledging the entirety of our experiences and emotions, we unlock fresh perspectives. I recall a pivotal moment when I confided in a friend during my darkest hour. Her simple acknowledgment of my pain — a quiet “That’s really sad” — fostered a profound sense of validation and liberation. Acceptance flourishes when we embrace our emotions without reservation.

**2 Through Surrender**

Central to the journey of acceptance is the act of surrender. For me, surrendering entails relinquishing control — letting go of our preconceived notions, desires, and expectations, and entrusting ourselves to a higher power. Cultivating this surrender requires cultivating a quiet mind and an open heart. By quieting the incessant chatter of our minds and embracing life’s unfolding journey with an open heart, we embark on a path of spiritual and emotional growth. Through this growth, we naturally gravitate towards acceptance, shedding that which no longer serves us.

**3 Through Patience**

One of my favorite tarot cards is the “Wheel of Fortune”. When the Wheel of Fortune is reversed, it means luck has not been on your side. It is likely that some external factors are affecting your life right now, and you may have to adapt to it and accept it with patience rather than attempting to control the situation. When we do not let go, it can only bring more suffering. When we learn to accept, we also learn to forgive ourselves. We learn to move on and move forward — and eventually, we learn that this feeling of acceptance can push the wheel forward again, moving it towards a new cycle.

I had gotten past the part of calming down, weeks and weeks of built up and I was ugly crying walking down the streets of Portland. A boy, probably a highschooler with a backpack on stopped and asked if I was in trouble. I, being on the phone with my mom, asked her to hang on a moment and I told him I was okay, not in danger just upset. He seemed truly concerned and didn't leave, instead he asked if I would like a hug. Now I was ugly crying, tears, snot, and not attractive. But a hug seemed great at that moment. With my mom on hold, I accepted the hug. This boy who was likely four or five years younger than me was still taller than I was and hugged me. He held me for several long moments while I cried and I truly felt comforted. Afterwards I thanked him and we parted. I never saw him again but I remember that act of kindness just for the sake of being kind and for no other reason.

Perhaps that's because I found it absurd not to identify, for example, with feelings of joy or love, which, to me, had rather sad vibes.

However, when it comes to more negative emotions like sadness, anger, etc., I could imagine the benefits.

But my biggest problem is that I don't know exactly how. If anyone has tips on that, I'm all ears. My history with feelings has been that I've automatically pushed them away and suppressed them my whole life.

Now I'm at a point where I can allow many feelings again, but it only works for me if I actively immerse myself in them, and these feelings only stay if they're allowed to completely consume me.

If I try to ""observe"" the whole thing from a sort of meta-self perspective, I quickly feel nothing at all.

But I think that if implemented correctly, the concept could help me a lot with something that's going wrong in my life, which I believe would exceed the scope of this topic.

I am a person who contantly has something or the other going through my mind at all times. The only time it stops is when I sleep. I don't think I am alone at this at all.

It's not like I am mindful about it... It will be something really random. Also, at times my brain starts singing this one or two lines of music in a constant loop. This also happens when I wake up some days and it's really annoying.

I easily get into my head a lot. I will imagine myself having conversations with people. I create all sorts of scenarios in my head and will be intensly going through it which doesn't even matter.

I also context switch a lot in my mind. One moment I will be thinking of something and then it suddenly changes to another thought.

I was not at all self aware that I did all this for a long time in my life. And just recently (few years ago) I started to notice it. I have been trying to meditate every day for at least 10 mins and when I get it right, it feels absolutely peaceful. But then most of the time I start to drift while doing it. I know that it is normal to drift and I just need to bring back my attention.

But, this constant random thoughts plus the constant context switching is really worrying me.

One other thing that I wanted to ask is about this kind of automation feeling that I get when I am in a social situation. I believe I have social anxiety, so when I am in such situation, it feels like I am speaking automatically, like it's not really me who is speaking. Once I am out of that situation, that's when I realize I was not really present at that moment.

Free your mind and the rest will follow. The Universe shape your experience and if you’re not mindful with what you fill the loop of life with, it can get hard. Existence is a dream with a dream within a dream…

Stay focused. Be in the immediate moment as often as you can, because that’s where and when you are in connection. It’s very important to stay conscious in this exact moment. It’s the only place that is real and it’s all that exists. For you. I am you. We are universes within universes. Consciousness is a universal force. Consciousness is life. And what is life. It’s you ✨

Stay curious. Focus on what’s important. Focus is energy. Energy is a creative force. If you’re stuck with self critical and negative thinking, that’s also where your focus will be and giving this negativity more energy, and you’ll experience discomfort in your feelings, and it will affect the Universe by forming it in a way that takes you even deeper in to this destructive state of mind. Situations will appear that will take you deeper in your belief that this negative state of mind is you. It’s a lie. You have a mind. You are consciousness.

How does one inspect these beliefs directly to see them? I believe that if I could see them in entirety as external objects, I would have more choice about whether I buy in to them.

As for specific techniques: if journaling, what exact technique to get to that 'witness' position on one's own beliefs? If meditation, how to be able to see the belief as a fully formed object from a distance without being sucked back into it?

One possible angle: what are beliefs? Are they jigsaw puzzles of thought that once glued together act like a 'megathought'?

I recently read ‘Mindfulness in Plain English’ and I’m a bit confused on Chapter 14: ‘Mindfulness versus Concentration’. 

It states that concentration and mindfulness are two different functions, the main goal of the Vipassana/insight meditation is to cultivate mindfulness. Concentration is one pointedness, forcing your mind to focus on one object. In this case, the breath. Mindfulness is the awareness that notices ‘distractions’ and brings back concentration to the breath. 

Now, the way I understood to meditate was just that. Sit, breathe, *concentrate* on your breath, and be *mindful* of any rising sensations or thoughts, and bring your awareness back to the breath. 

Where I’m confused is when it says ‘Put most of your effort into one pointedness at the beginning. Just keep calling the attention from wandering over and over again. Tough it out’ as a recommendation to beginners with the ‘monkey mind’. He then states that after a couple of months of developing concentration, to ‘start pumping your energy into mindfulness’. 

What does this mean exactly? Isn’t the act of calling the attention from wandering mindfulness in itself? Does he mean at the beginning to maintain ‘one pointedness’ on the breath, and after developing concentration skills for a while, perhaps moving on to mindfully interacting and observing rising thoughts and sensations instead of anchoring yourself to the breath? Am I getting this right?

Thanks in advance! Happy to learn and grow.

for a large chunk of my life i’ve always been known as the firecracker, quick to step in, and speak up friend. my actions were often impulsive because they were based on emotion, but i felt proud of myself that people knew me as some boss that doesn’t take shit from anyone. i was NEVER physical; just confrontational, enough to the point where people knew to not test me. i liked being seen as intimidating (sometimes i still do, I’m human LOL!) it was more of a self perseveration tactic, which is another topic in itself.

about a year and a half ago i had a mirror held up to me a few times. whether it be in conversations, the way certain people acted around me or how seriously they took me, and introspection. i used to think that all of my actions and behaviors were appropriate responses to the situations, and i owed no one an apology for acting in “the right”.

no one ever sat me down and directly told me, “hey, i get what you’re doing and where you’re coming from, but we need to dial it back”. and frankly, im a grown adult. im responsible for my actions. until recently, i thought the slight shift (SLIGHT) in my medications was responsible for my growth and development in reacting on impulse and misplaced anger. but there have been a few times where i still struggle, and im genuinely working on myself.

here are a few of my “rules and reminders” for a lack of better words to keep me grounded (some of these might be obvious to yall idk): 

1. if someone or something is bothering you and it is not a PRESSING MATTER, sit on it. let the first bout of emotions go through (don’t ignore them), and then reflect. if after a while it no longer holds so much space in your head, make note of it (in case it’s continued behavior, etc), and keep it pushing.
    a. currently dealing with this now as my one of my roommates got pretty snippy at me the entire afternoon for i have no idea why. she was being fine and fun with my other roommate as well. my old self would’ve said something along the lines of “why are you being so bitchy” or “what the fuck is your problem” as it kept piling on. i took it all in, continued our evening like normal. i didn’t forget it happened, but I’m not going to confront that behavior with the same back, knowing mine will be 10x worse. tomorrow, i can reflect and see it that’s something i want to bring up to her, or be okay with ignoring it as i know i did nothing to provoke that behavior from her. 

2. never confront anyone over text unless that’s the only way to address a situation. i also don’t call it confrontation, i refer to it as “making good”. this can be making good with just yourself so that you can or with the other person

3. rule #2 DOES NOT necessarily mean forgiveness.  you can make good with a situation without forgetting and forgiving, it’s just allowing your brain to “move through it” without it sitting so heavily on your mind all the time. (there are obvious situations where it will be hard not to continuously think about it or relive it)

4. as much as it may seem that way in the moment, snapping back is not in your best interest. even if warranted. in my experience, people expected that behavior from me. i lost respect from people every time i reacted. now, when i bite my tongue or reply cordially, there’s an atmosphere change.

5. people will try you. they want you to act out of character, they want you to poke the bear. people will also outwardly not like you whether it’s because of past behavior or for no good reason. don’t let that occupy space in your head and try to subconsciously or consciously prove something to them.

6. i have ocd so this is a big one for me: your nightly ruminations do not mean you need to immediately text this person and solve whatever “conflict” you have in that moment. just because you seem calm and have put a lot of thought into it, doesn’t means the best time to send a massive paragraph is at 11:30pm before bed. your ruminations are piling on emotions as you continue to think about it, so you might not be as level-headed as you think.

7. not everything is a personal attack!! reframe the experience!! the person might not be calling YOU as a person the problem.

8. know. your. triggers. this helps you recognize that this is a trigger before you react, and again, could not be personal.

9. don’t let things build up. i know i said that sometimes it’s ok to move on and just remember that it happened, but you know yourself best. if this is something that is gonna be piled on when you finally do make good with the person/experience, it’s best to express it now so that you aren’t dropping a ton of information on them that you were essentially holding.

10. most importantly, recharge. however you feel is best. i know when i’m overstimulated, really stressed, or tired i’m more likely to snap on someone or something. 

i don’t know if this will help anyone or if anyone can relate but i wanted to put it out there, a lot of my tips are tailored towards my specific triggers and situations i find myself in but imsure you can work some words around!! healing is not linear, i still fuck up sometimes, but now i can better recognize where i went wrong and work on that.",False,emotional reactivity and impulsivity mindfulness tips :) ,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/1bo09la/emotional_reactivity_and_impulsivity_mindfulness/

Some of mine:

* ""you should meditate for at least half an hour every day (subtext: or you might as well not bother)"".  For me, 15 minutes most days gives me a benefit I can feel.
* ""the breath is the best meditation object"". For me, pretty much *anything* works better than the breath. I find the breath unsettling and agitating. Metta, body scan, grounding, touch, sound, pain, discomfort, walking meditation -- all good. The breath? urgh.
* ""get up early to meditate, even if it means getting less sleep"". For me, meditation turns out not to compensate for sleep deprivation, and getting enough sleep does more for my quality of life than a long meditation session. So if I'm forced to choose, I now forego the meditation in favour of getting enough sleep.
* ""do every activity mindfully"". For me, that turns out to be impossible (except perhaps on retreat) because directing attention (even if only gently) requires willpower and willpower if finite. The brain needs a rest sometimes, and that means allowing attention to wander with no deliberate attempt to either watch or control it. 'Trying to be mindful' *all the time* just made me exhuasted and frustrated. These days I find mindfulness naturally seeps into daily activities if I'm meditating regularly. That's fine.

Hi! This is a cool community, I am both hoping to find a bit of solace here and also hoping nobody else feels this way lol. 

Like a year ago, I (21 M) just kind of suddenly woke up with anxiety. I had never had a panic attack, had always been very confident/charismatic, and never could even understand the concept of social anxiety. I thought this sudden onset had something to do with PTSD, so I went to some trauma therapy and did EMDR, which actually helped a bit. Then, I studied abroad and everything felt fine (for the most part). However, now that I’m in my last semester before graduating and have returned to the US, I just feel awful. 

I’m not looking for a diagnosis at all, but I am wondering if anyone has felt any/all of the following symptoms and if anyone has advice for dealing with it.

Basically, the last month has felt like one giant drawn out panic attack — it feels like I’m basically always on the verge of the next attack. Even had a panic attack in a movie theater surrounded by my best friends. No common thread between anything, except for maybe worse anxiety when in crowds/smaller places/places that seem like they’d be hard to escape. I also developed a weird new compulsive fear of vomiting in public, for some reason it’s like almost all I think about when I’m out. Also noticed a strange appearance of semi-claustrophobia. Brain has been extra noisy lately, like I’m being bombarded by 10-20 different conversations every second. Hard to sleep but in a weird way, where I can fall “asleep” easily but basically feel like I’m floating above sleep but beneath consciousness for 8 hours — almost always wake up feeling exhausted. Spend most of the day in a dream state almost feeling like I’m blind, can’t see or really process anything around me or even myself. Kind of just trotting through life. Panic attacks are quick, 30 second to 10 minute bursts where I blackout, shake, am extremely nauseous, and almost completely removed from mental/physical control of my body. Almost like I took a laced hallucinogen or something, they’re awful. Haven’t figured out how to stop their onset, not even with breathing techniques or walking around. 

I’m not depressed/sad, but I am starting to feel miserable living this way. 


I study neuroscience and am familiar with the mechanisms of anxiety, but for the most part I’m an emotional represser and do not have good mental health hygiene lol.

But because we have human brains, it can be hard to stay in the ""zone"" or be mindful all the time. There is a part of our brain called the default mode network (or DMN) which is partly responsible for our wandering mind that has you thinking about that silly cat video when you should be working.

The cool part? The more we intentionally try to stay mindful, the better we get at it. When that happens, the default mode network begins to cool down just a bit, and the wandering mind begins to settle. 

That doesn't mean random thoughts won't pop up or you won't get distracted from what you are doing, that will still happen. And when it does, gently, and non-judgmentally come back to what you are doing.

>  
>\~ Marcus Aurelius, Meditations (7.69)

Life is hectic now, and was still hectic back in the times of Ancient Rome. No matter your income status, education, or background, circumstances constantly pressured people to perform.

However, what were people performing for was, and still is, the real question.

Marcus Aurelius was constantly dealt with the pressures of being an Emperor (a.k.a. one of the most powerful individuals on Earth), but as we all know, great power comes with great responsibility: starving citizens, mass debt, wars, and the blame ultimately falling on his shoulders. So how did he live his stressful days?

By making sure that he’s doing the best he could.

By ensuring that he’s striving for perfection whenever possible, as much as possible.

By reflecting that tomorrow is never guaranteed, and because of that, we should act our finest today.

If we knew that it was potentially our last day on Earth, what would you rather do? Spiral into an uncontrolled frenzy and become careless, or live with the upmost determination to not allow our impressions and emotions get the better of us? To live with the discipline and satisfaction that you maintained your character throughout hardship? Stoicism encompasses the latter.

Regardless of our circumstances, we always have the opportunity to be ‘perfect’. We always have the opportunity to live our last days without anger, sloth, hysteria, and vices we wouldn’t normally want, and instead live those days with wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance.

Take the opportunity before it’s gone forever.

During one such conversation, I asked him a question that had been weighing on my mind for some time: “How do you feel about the endings and losses in your life?”

With a gentle smile, he responded in a way that caught me off guard, yet resonated deeply within me. “I feel sad, but I think it’s for the best,” he said, his words carrying an air of lightness. In that moment, I couldn’t fully comprehend the profound wisdom concealed in his concise response, but as time went on, its meaning began to unfold before me.

**In life, we may not always receive what we desire, but we will always receive what we truly need.** Each ending signifies the completion of its purpose in our lives, making room for something new to enter, fostering our growth and learning. Life is a constant ebb and flow, ever-changing and evolving. Rather than dwelling on the losses, it’s essential to acknowledge the reality that everything in life is impermanent, imperfect, and incomplete.

What truly helped me embrace this truth is a book titled “Wabi Sabi,” written by Beth Kempton. “Wabi Sabi” is a Japanese aesthetic concept that is centered around finding beauty in imperfection and accepting the natural cycle of growth and decay. The term is derived from two separate concepts:

“Wabi” refers to simplicity, humility, and living in tune with nature. It conveys a sense of rustic beauty and quietness that comes with age.

“Sabi” is more connected with the passage of time, with the way that all things grow and decay. It reminds us of our own connection with the past, of the natural cycle of life, and of our very own mortality.

**Wabi Sabi teaches us that dynamic transience is the natural state of all things.** As change is inevitable, trying to hold on to the past is pointless and stressful. It encourages us to choose the path of serenity and contentment by accepting where we are in the natural cycle of our life.

If we are open to changes and transitions, instead of holding on too tight to what has been, we can experience great insights and flow into the next stage, whether or not we feel ready.

I've been immersing myself in the teachings of mindfulness luminaries like Eckhart Tolle, Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche, Alan Watts, and J. Krishnamurti just to name a few. This journey has led to moments of awareness in everyday activities, such as a newfound mindfulness while gaming. This shift towards observing rather than just experiencing has sparked a crucial question in me: what's the next step?

I'm particularly curious about the possibility of maintaining this state of awareness constantly. However, I recognize that living in such a heightened state of mindfulness all the time seems incredibly challenging. Despite this, I wonder if it's possible to engage fully with the world, enjoying every moment without detachment, where even in gaming, the outcome becomes irrelevant to my joy and peace.

How can I deepen my mindfulness practice from simply being aware to living in a constant state of awareness without losing connection to the joy of experiences? Is there a way to navigate this without becoming detached from the highs and lows of life?

Any of these can be in control of the system and thus the source of ""self"", or the thing that says ""I"". 

One of these centers is the moral center, which I think is possibly close to visualization, since you are visualizing future actions based on a variety of criteria and deciding what the best criteria is.

There are ""lower"" centers, like your sex drive. These aren't bad, but they are lower in the sense that less thought and less civilization originates out of them.

So, I think the moral self is stuck in a ""reincarnation"" cycle because it is continuously remade when it is not in control of itself. When it must reform itself to allow for various ""loud voices"" in the body, be it hunger, sex, or even status seeking, it cannot be a permanent force. 

I think the idea of ""samsara"" is all of these things that make up the inner environment around the moral self. This moral self stops its ""reincarnation"" by gaining control of the whole system, which is the achievement of free will and the establishment of self-directed morality. 

This moral self lives an ""infinite life"" in the sense that it is connected to the infinite (the cosmos, the ancestry of humanity, the future of humanity) but does not physically live an infinite life.

However, there is another concept of the ""fountain of youth"" that I think bears mentioning. 

These various ""centers"" in your body are all controlled by your mind. Or at least, through biofeedback, you can learn to take control of them. The point is that your mind is the control center for the most important tasks. That much should be obvious. What is the mind but a maze? Every thought is a complete neural circuit that is ""remembered"" because a circuit is more easily activated a second time after the first activation strengthens particular connections (so you could mathematically define each thought as a large multivariate function, but that's another matter).

What happens when you ""forget"" a thought? You have lost the strength in the activation functions that completed that particular neural circuit. This is frankly just what aging does. It's not difficult to remember the most important thought circuits, but everyone is forgetting something at every minute of the day. Forgetting is somewhat equivalent to filtering, which can be a good thing. However, what happens when you have too much of a good thing, particularly when this process becomes driven by physical changes more than conscious effort? This aging doesn't _have_ to happen late in life. Stress and trauma ages your brain very quickly. Well, what happens? You start losing parts of your self, including the good parts.

So, the ""fountain of youth"" is the thing that regenerates neural connections. There's some amount of meditation that can be done to solve this problem. Entheogens, or psychedelic drugs, can also help accomplish this, and they were a core part of the ancient esoteric tradition. Neurogeneration _does_ come with a lot of potential side effects, so it's important to know that too. You could connect parts of the mind that shouldn't be connected, leading to something as silly as a hallucination, as painful as a headache, as scary as a schizophrenic delusion. If you are skilled at navigating altered states of consciousness, then this looks much more like a burst of creativity with little harm to yourself. In any case, dose and mindfulness does matter.

I return to the point about the mind as a maze. What is it to think? You search through a neural maze until you arrive at the thought you are looking for. This is what the bull of Theseus is. It's a thought Theseus had to find in himself. And presumably it was a ""demon"", or bad thought, so he had to ""kill it"" or erase it from his memory.

The fountain of youth essentially changes the default structure of your ""maze"", enabling you to almost go through walls in your mind.",False,Trying to define reincarnation and a few other things,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/1bl94pk/trying_to_define_reincarnation_and_a_few_other/

There’s one thing I can guarantee that has happened to you: you’ve never not been in an argument or a debate. At some point in all of our lives, we’ve been involved in a verbal dispute advocating for our beliefs.

And whenever we’re in an argument or a debate, the natural human inclination is to prove the other side wrong. Or prove them wrong according to our standards, at least.

But to fall in line with the Stoic Philosophy, we must remember that there should only be two avenues during this type of situation: calm persuasion and patience.

If you’re supporting a side in a discussion, calm persuasion is what we should invoke with the emphasis on ‘calm’. Calmly control your emotional responses and do not allow anger or resentment to transpire simply because the persuasion was unconvincing.

There should be no reason to become angered as a result of a failed persuasion, and that’s why we’re given patience for a reason. We won’t be able to convince everybody we come across and as a result, we have to bear with that reality.

The next time you catch yourself beginning to argue unnecessarily or debating with the objective of winning rather than the truth, ask yourself if you can convince them. If you can, go ahead, but only do so calmy and non-excessively.

If you can’t, enact the patience and control to not let your emotions get the better of you.

I have been meditating regularly for years now and am finally starting to realize how I can apply those same mindfulness skills to my waking life outside of meditation.

This might be better phrased in an example. I found that being present often helps me in social situations as it allows me to be more relaxed. I often have the problem of overthinking social situations. Being present helps that, but wouldn't it sometimes be good to think about how I act socially so I can improve it? 

Like there have been cases where I have done something that may have been awkward and upon reflection I learned how I could better react in the future.

This expands beyond social situations, though. If I'm mindful all of the time and being present to my surroundings, when do I take time to think about what I'm doing or what I have done? Just because I am present doesn't mean that I am going through life in the best way that I can?

It’s two-thirty a.m. I light a small candle, hang up my mosquito net and put on my robes. The forest is quiet now, in this back water heavily forested area of 1981, and later 1997 Northeast Thailand. I have been meditating since ten p.m. in my hut.

The narrow trail through the forest to the main hall is about half a mile. I direct my lantern a few yards ahead in case a Banded Krait, Cobra or Russell Viper might be lying on the path. The morning is pleasant, no torrential rains or mud today.

My mind is easy and free. Living on my own in this forest has had its effect, especially the meditation and the Buddhist discipline of 227 rules. Many major rules had to be followed according to the letter, such as not killing living beings, no sex or even masturbation, no stealing or lying. Minor rules included such things as not standing while urinating, not picking flowers or fruit, or killing plants in any way even breaking live twigs. No digging in the ground, touching money or its representative, not drinking alcohol.

I could only eat food that was offered that day had to eat it before noon; I could not save it for later. And when I did eat, I had to eat quickly and not leisurely. I didn’t use utensils and instead used my fingers to eat out of my alms bowl.

This was a life of discipline and dependency, and it had more of an effect on me than I imagined it would. Just talking about it now brings a tear. The Buddha Once said that the tears we shed over our many lifetimes will fill an ocean. I see the truth of that.

I continue walking through the night toward the main hall. A Barking Deer abruptly jumps across the path and crashes into the jungle. I watch it, calmly, intently with no reaction of fear. The illnesses, as well as the contemplations of human existence all sharpened by the shifts in consciousness brought about by meditation have dulled any semblance of fear.

In the moonlight, my solitary friend, I can see the hall ahead. My job is to ring the monastery bell at three a.m. alerting the community that it is time to meditate until we head out together on alms round. I climb the steps of the bell platform, noticing a skull in the adjoining cremation pit from yesterday’s service that seems to be looking up at me and smiling in the glow of the dying embers. I ring the bell in the traditional cadence; the Buddhist Theravada monastic practice that I am living is basically unchanged from when the Buddha lived 2500 years ago. 

I light the candles in the hall, there is no electricity in this area, and find a spot on the cement floor. I go back into meditation. The community drifts in and the monks and nuns find places on the floor as well. We meditate until a senior monk can make out the lines on the palm of his hand in the breaking dawn, after which we put on our outer robes and begin walking to the surrounding villages for alms.

I join a small group of monks that have a route across some fields toward the east and the rising sun. We walk through many rice paddies with scores of snakes, both in the water and on the banks, craning their bodies and flicking their tongues to smell what is coming. Mango and banana trees speckle the landscape as a floating red ball dances on the horizon to great us. Everything is pristine and peaceful with the monks walking in silence concentrating on their meditation.

Our walk to the village and back would begin in the forest past orchids and blossoms of every description that closed in on our path. Colorful birds would frolic in the trees and large-eared squirrels would busily scurry along the ground. Oozing out of the clacking bamboo groves and large feathery ferns hung pungent odors of the jungle that accompanied us until we would break out into the rice fields, eventually making our way down the narrow lanes that were fenced on both sides.

Water Buffalo tied underneath villager’s dwellings would cast wary eyes, lowering their heads in annoyance as we approached. Whether our presence reminded them that soon they would be led to the rice paddies for a day of toil, or whether they just didn’t care for orange-colored robes was immaterial; the fact was that they didn’t like monks.

The villages were filled with activities – dogs with horribly scarred bodies with missing ears and mangy fur running loose and fighting in the streets (and sometimes nipping at the heels of the last monk in line) with many infected with rabies. Mothers standing outside of their huts bathing their children by throwing cold buckets of water on their chilled bodies. The villagers would stop their activities as we walked by, with their hands clasped at their chests or at their foreheads out of respect for the men who have dedicated their lives to find the deathless.

I glanced back at one of the mothers one day. She was happy within this precious snapshot of life. Who in the many worlds could be more content than this presumably impoverished villager and her baby at that moment? What wealth and power could surpass the happiness she was feeling in that small village?

My feet have finally toughened up after many months, and the pain of walking on the rough, pointed gravel in the villages is no longer a problem. It’s been a good year for the villagers and I find in my bowl a few fruit drinks in their little square, waxed packages. We return to the hall and sit cross-legged on the raised platform with our bowls. This meal that we now eat in the hall will be our only food for the day.

The villagers file in and sit on the floor in the center of the hall, watching intently. When some villagers walk by the line of monks and offer additional food, I try not to look closely at their offerings keeping my eyes down. Later, I mix it all together as a dhutanga practice, but also to disguise the courser foods and other things that end up in my bowl that I’m not yet accustomed to. The villagers sacrifice to make certain the monks and nuns are cared for, giving us the best food they have to offer including whatever scarce protein they can literally dig up. They look up to us as their ideals, leaving me with a feeling of tremendous responsibility to live up to their expectations by training as hard as I can.

After the meal, we go outside and wash our bowls in the stream, after which we tip them up facing the sun to dry. We say a few words to each other, and then retreat to our huts for the rest of the morning and early afternoon. This is when I do most of my napping, along with my walking meditation so that I can sit in meditation most of the night and early morning when it is cooler, and when I find the mind to be the most concentrated.

It’s four p.m. I have been napping and doing walking meditation since the morning meal. My hut is deep in the forest, situated on the upper end of a massive flat shelf-rock with large flat rocks on both sides, crossed by deep ravines separating them which are havens for the cobras. Surrounding everything is dense jungle.

My forty two square foot hut is perched on four high stilts, and on the bottom of each stilt is pan filled with kerosene to keep out ants and termites. Eight steps lead up to a small porch at the entrance of the hut, which has two windows with shutters to keep out monsoon rains. The hut has been spared by the fierce lightening so far.

The tin roof holds up well during the rains and is clear of low-hanging limbs that would invite snakes to become unwelcome guests. On the floor is my lantern and a dinged teapot which serves as my water jug. On a two by four on the wall sits some incense and candles, and an empty tin can cut in half, that I heat water in with a candle, to shave. A pair of geckos complete the adornments, the ever-present foot long lizards that populate the forest. This humble hut and its furnishings become the most precious dwelling I had ever lived in, along with my most precious friend, the moon at the window.

The wall and floors are made of planks cut from large logs manually with a two-man saw. This was backbreaking, tedious work by the young men in the village who made the forty-foot-long cuts end to end of the large logs to fashion the boards. They will work all day, sunup to sundown, with only occasional breaks to drink a Coke and eat a few bites of rice. These impoverished villagers gave up a great deal of their time and resources to support the monks and nuns, and I vow to work as hard as I can to gain a little insight so that I might be able to pass it on to them. Their generosity astounds me, as does their happy, cheerful existence in these small villages.

A monk’s routine in Thailand varies little no matter where he stays. Now, at four p.m. I will join my fellow monks at the well near the main hall where we each draw a bucket of cold water for our daily bath. The bathing area also serves as a meeting place where we meet twice a month to make our brooms for sweeping our paths and to wash and dye our robes by boiling them with the orange bark of the Jack Fruit tree.

There also might be a cremation in the afternoon. In 1981 Thailand, families might lose as many as half of their children to the many diseases and snakes that the mostly malnourished children, living primarily on white, polished rice, were exposed to. Malaria, dysentery, cholera, hepatitis, Japanese Encephalitis, rabies - all ran rampant. The first cremation I witnessed involved a small child, maybe six years old, so pretty with her long black hair combed so carefully, with a pink ribbon tied on the side. She appeared to be peacefully sleeping, as her family carried her of foot into the monastery.

I vividly recall the fire becoming extremely hot once the branches were lit, and in only moments, her shiny black hair sizzled quickly, and then was gone. The skin on her face then blistered and was gone as well, exposing the white skull underneath. The little body blackened quickly, its limbs curling up into a fetal position before it began cooking. The dramatic memory of this child stayed with me for weeks, as the senior monks warned it would, and it was some time before the skulls that appeared on my kuti (hut) walls every evening in the candlelight, disappeared.

In those days the cremation pit consisted of four long stakes pounded into the ground with the space between filled with stacks of dry limbs and twigs. The parents would place their child on the middle of the stack, after which the father would join a group of men off to the side where they would sit on their heels and smoke cigarettes, while the mother would toss candies up in the air. At times, however, I did see mothers off to the side crying quietly because it was not considered appropriate in Thai culture to make a spectacle of oneself.

Evenings are a blessed relief in Thailand, still warm but without the smothering heat and humidity of the day. If I wasn’t in my kuti meditating in the evenings, I would be in the main hall (sala) chanting along with the other monks, or maybe sitting out in the jungle tempting snakes to crawl onto my lap, or a rabid dog to come sniffing around. At other times, we would gather under the Abbot’s hut for a talk. His hut is fancy, with a profusion of plants and flowers on all sides. The hut itself is small, not much bigger than mine but because it is built on an elevated veranda supported by high, elaborate pillars, the entire structure has the appearance of a massive building with plenty of room underneath for the entire community.

For meetings, the abbot is seated under his kuti and fanned with giant banana leaves by two of his monks, and except for the fierce mosquitoes preparing to feast on us (and hopefully not carrying any bad strains of malaria), all is deadly quiet as the monks continue to fan their abbot. The humidity is tangible; the still air heavily laden with moisture as storms brew during this monsoon season. Nobody speaks or moves after we all file in and find a seat on the concrete floor. It is perfectly silent, a powerful silence with monks and nuns sitting peacefully, not making a sound.

Part of living in a Thai Monastery involves shaving one’s head every two weeks. It takes a while to learn how to do it comfortably with no mirrors and straight razors, or razors with the safeties removed. That evening we meet in the hall at midnight where one of the monks recites the patimoka, the 227 monk rules. This is done by memory, in Pali, and takes about 45 minutes reciting as fast as possible. Then we sit together all night until daybreak when we resume our regular schedule and go on alms round.

A few village families always attend these all-night vigils sitting with us, waiting for the three-a.m. talk by the abbot. The villagers would then go back to work in the fields the next day not missing a beat.

The full moon nights where we would immerse ourselves in meditation are one of my fondest memories of Thailand, along with the serene mornings sitting together in the hall, the trips to the villages, and the days we gathered to dye our robes. My fellow monks nursed my body when it was ill, as well as my spirits. They fed me honey and bananas for the dysentery, and even convinced me to drink my urine to cure my many other maladies. The solitary life of these forest monks and nuns leaves few footprints on this earth, making little kamma through their selfless actions and peaceful existence.

It's unfortunate that few, outside of Thailand, know about their sacrifices and the positive impact their solitary lives have on the culture. Perhaps the quality that rang so true regarding these selfless meditators was that nobody was ‘home.’ No ‘self’ was inside. Their outside attention was always directed toward others, toward compassion, and they themselves were no different from whatever arose in their consciousness.

Sort of a first-world-problem.

If we look at the history of web, information overload was supposed to be a temporary issue. It was thought that with the advance of technology, better algorithms would solve this issue for the most part, i.e we will have better filters. So the problem back then was considered to be as ""Filter Failure"".

Nicholas Carr explained the problem wasn't filter failure, in fact it was ""Filter Success"". In a world of infinite information, we actually got tons better at sifting the wheat from the chaff. A lot of people described the problem as ""finding a needle in a haystack"". Carr described it the best, it isn't about finding a needle in a haystack, in fact, it is too many ""haystack-sized piles of needles"". The point that Carr is trying to make is, that lots of the other ways in which we feel overwhelmed are problems of ""too many needles"". They attempt to divide our finite time and attention among too many things that all have a legitimate claim on them. In fact, most of the productivity and time management advices take the needle-in-a-haystack approach, i.e. becoming more efficient, organised and better at prioritising. Reducing the size of the haystacks to make it easier to focus on the needle. There's for sure a place for such techniques. But in the end, we're left with too-many-needles problem.

We need to accept that it's not about making space for all your ""big rocks"" but of accepting that there are simply too many rocks to fit in the jar.

To give another analogy by Oliver Burkeman, it's not about making buckets of to-dos eventually leaving ourselves feeling way too overwhelmed BUT treating our ""to dos"" pile like a river. A stream that flows past you, and from which you pluck a few choice items, here and there) instead of a bucket (which demands that we empty it).

Looking at life this way definitely is tougher, but it's liberating.

Let me start by saying I have ''Pure OCD'', which means my compulsions are mental and/or internal and I’ve been listening to guided meditations for like 5 months. However, at the time my OCD was severe and I’d just been fired from my job, as I didn’t pass probation period and this among many other factors/events triggered my OCD and I was 29 at the time. My OCD theme consists of reliving the past and how I had ''wasted my twenties''. I wanted the last year of my twenties to be perfect and since things didn't turn out like I expected, I was frustrated and started obsessing over it by ruminating/reliving the past, reviewing the bad days vs the good days in my head and wishing things had been different and not accepting things the way they happened. So I made an appointment with a psychologist at the time, but it was all talk therapy and she wasn’t helping me at all. So another reason I had to quit therapy with her was because there were some things I didn't like about her and I didn't feel comfortable with her anymore. However, in order to cope with those overwhelming emotions/ and the distress they caused, I started listening to these guided meditations and they have helped a lot.

On the one hand, I remember there were times when I was in the middle of a thought loop, feeling very overwhelmed and distressed and after listening to a 20 min meditation video, I felt very relaxed and I was able to feel good during the rest of my day. On the other hand, the only thing meditation isn't helping me with are the “urges to engage with ruminations/compulsions’’ and I usually end up ''giving in''. I mean, I feel it doesn't take away these urges to engage with ruminations /compulsions (rumination is my main compulsion, as I have ''Pure OCD''). Like I said, it helps me relax this hyperactive mind and it was a huge relief from those times when I was distressed.

When it comes to OCD I've heard the golden treatment for it is ERP and in these days I'm saving some money to look for a therapist who does ERP. In the meantime, do you think I should stick with these ''guided meditations'' according to everything I said in my post or are they useless?

Are guided meditations as effective as non-guided meditations?

Don't get me wrong, meditation has helped me a lot with anxiety. Whereas, my only complaint with it is that it doesn't take away these urges to engage with the ruminations/compulsions and I usually give in, even though it has helped me relax when I was distressed/ overwhelmed by emotions and has helped me with anxiety, too.

sometime ago i learned that when buddhist monks are listening to dharma talks, they are also continuing their meditative state. psychologists tell us that the human mind can focus on four objects at once.

the primary benefit of quad-focus meditation is that it incorporates four objects into the meditative practice, so that distraction from any one of the objects is more likely to land on one of the other three, thereby better containing distractions within the meditation.

the first object of quad-focus meditation is the silent recitation of the mantra, aum. aum essentially means all that is, ever has been, and ever will be. it is synonymous with the concept of god in it's most universal and scientific formulation.

the second object of quad-focus meditation is awareness of the breath. this awareness coincides with the first object of silently reciting the mantra. one silently recites the mantra with each outbreath.

the third object of quad-focus meditation is a gentle, closed-mouth, mona lisa or buddha-like, smile. pleasure and happiness are our fundamental motivations in life, and evoking the mood of happiness through this gentle smile maintains our highest desired state throughout the meditative session.

the fourth object of quad-focus meditation is an organic practice of the body scan. with the intention of covering the entire body, one allows one's mind to simply become mindful, or aware, of the different parts, according to its discretion.

experimenting with the practice, i'm realizing that it's comprised of two diads. the first is the breath-mantra relationship and the second is the smile-body scan. it seems that the smile evokes a feeling of happiness that can then be sensed throughout the body.

i've been working with this for the last few days, and am pleased with the results. if it makes sense to you, let us know your experience.

I’ve done mindfulness meditations for short bursts here and there throughout my life but could never stick to them and sometimes found them very difficult to actually do. 

I recently realised that I have adhd and my therapist suggested that I take it up again but with a focus on noting my thoughts and feelings in a nonjudgmental manner + acknowledging that I’m going to have a lot more mental distractions due to the adhd (I tend to mentally beat myself up for having any negative thoughts and feelings + losing focus).

I found one guided meditation on YT that centred around actually focusing on how anxiety/discomfort felt in the body and it was super helpful for me. 

I want to find some more guided meditations that are suitable for adhd and focus on accepting and being non-judgemental towards thoughts and feelings. 

Does anyone have any recommendations/resources that they’re willing to share??

I've been really mentally struggling lately and my friend introduced me to Living Untethered. I'm not really understanding what it's trying to say and I'm not connecting with it. And some of it even comes off as a bit naive to me with a certain viewpoint. I think I'm just wondering what I am missing.

I'm not quite done with the book because I have about 2 hours left to listen to but I hit a spot in the book that just made me turn it off. This was after hours of either my thought process being ""that makes sense but everybody knows that"" to ""that's not the way the human mind works at all"". At least not in my perspective.

He mentions that we are not our emotions or our feelings. We are just witnessing them. But that makes no sense to me because my emotions and feelings are internal just like I am. They are like feelers out into the world used to navigate both the physical and the emotional/spiritual sides to it. To say that I am not them and they are not me seems wrong. Am I not understanding what he's trying to say? I know to try not to let them rule me but to say that they are not me and I am not them does not make sense.

And my hard stop was when he said that suffering comes from inside and not from the external. This seems very wrong to me. It seems to disregard those that have been abused or assaulted or hurt by others. That suffering did not come from inside of them. That was an external action that caused a permanent scar. It's not something you can just easily get over and I don't understand how his viewpoint even pertains to that.

Maybe someone here can kind of summarize what I'm missing or not. Maybe I'm just venting, I'm not sure. I've been in my shell of armor for most of my 35 years of my life and I'm having a lot of trouble connecting with this and maybe I'm wrong and just resisting it and not seeing the real picture.

A thought loop is a repetitive cycle of thought. Generally, it is something that is very difficult to get out of. Your mindfulness and willpower will obviously affect your capacity to stop it. 

That being said, thought loops can be good _and_ bad. Imagine you are focused on your work and your family, so you are looping through the most important actions you can take on a daily basis. That's a pretty good orientation.

On the other hand, you could be living a nightmare. You might suffer from addiction, depression, or another sort of self-harming thought pattern, and you can't get out of it. While we often think of the content of the thought (ie depression, addiction, etc), I would suggest that these are actually repetitive thought disorders.

Now, I want to segue into mythology and ancient philosophy, to see if this idea explains any of their ideas.

Being ""trapped in a thought"" is a lot like being trapped in hell, or one of many ""worlds"". For instance, in Norse mythology, there were 7 worlds. There was hell, heaven, and many places in between. I believe this is a conception of a noosphere, or a world of ideas. So, one is ""in"" a world when you adopt the archetypal ideas that define it. This idea of dividing the universe into archetypal thought worlds is pretty foundational to a lot of myths.

Some people discussed whether this (physical) world is more or less real than these ideal worlds, but I don't think that's a very interesting question to get lost in. If you define ""real"" in terms of physical things, then the physical world is more real. If you define ""real"" in terms of experience, then the noosphere is more real. Either way, you're creating logical systems that validate your preconceptions, by defining ""real"" before you get to determining what is real.

I think there are two major disorders one could have in this category. 

1. One is that you are trapped in a bad world, or a world where you are essentially slave to something else. Thus, you lack free will. This might be being slave to addiction, to depression, or just some other obsession. Your will is literally locked into this thought pattern and is thus not fully free. I think we would describe a healthy state as still being locked into a thought pattern, but one which is based on your own morality rather than anything else. If you think it is moral to do something and thus continue to do it, it's not lacking in free will, even if you are acting more or less automatically. (This is a tangent, so I'll leave it at that for now.)

2. Another is that you are incapable of being trapped in any productive world. Naturally, I think this would co-occur with #1, but there are a lot of assumptions baked into that view. What if you grew up in a primitive world that lacked the stimulation to turn you into a sophisticated human being? What if you lacked a deep grasp of language? Basic tools like reading, writing, mathematics, and reasoning are required to be productive. However, most people in the developed world have those things, so there's something else going on when people struggle to enter a productive thought loop. I believe this is the closest description to what people really mean when people describe ""NPCs"" and ""people who are asleep"". However, it'd be more accurate to say they are hyper-awake. The former case of being trapped in a bad world is being asleep and unable to wake up (in other words, unable to break the thought pattern), but this case is lacking any deep thought pattern at all. Aside from the aforementioned addictions, the main things I would blame on this condition are things like television, social media, and news/informational channels that lack any deep thought. In other words, things that create illusion. This illusion traps you in the _outside_ world, preventing you from entering your inner world, preventing you from thinking and becoming a real human.

I think this is also a description of the hero's or fool's journey. The process of personal transformation is the metaphorical conquering of demons as described in this ubiquitous story format. The 'demon' is whatever is making you a certain way. It's your ""daemon"", your automatic process. To kill a demon is to experience a partial ego death. The ego is the thing that wants things.

\-A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE...

When we are born into this world, upon our arrival we find ourselves within a system that has long been in play... a system that near the entire populace has assumed as their very identity seemingly without question. You grow up within this system adapting to its ways, blending in and inevitably becoming another insignificant piece in someone else’s twisted game of life.

Much more than often this is the way people’s lives will carry on until their last breath, and the reason that the majority of an entire populace could go centuries upon centuries living these seemingly meaningless lives, is due to the absence and suppression of Life’s most fundamental knowledge, which is mankind’s connection to its own inner nature and the world surrounding... ‘

This system that we find ourselves within has very intentionally bred this self-knowledge out of the perceived reality… mentally, physically, genetically… this being the reason why more than often the modern Individual can never awaken to their true potential, which would enable them to manifest and Experience a much higher quality of life… one where the innumerable unseen and unacknowledged Influences would not have complete sway over them, because they would no longer be in the dark and oblivious to their existence.

But for those old souls who find themselves unlocking the Esoteric secrets of life and embodying an awareness which rises above the blind submission that is all around them… an entirely new experience is possible and at your fingertips… the life that we all deserve to live, One could accurately call it a second chance at life.

Of course, this message will only be received of by those who are meant to see it... friends and acquaintances that have synchronized their way to these words, which in essence are missed by the masses in one form of the other all around the world… but to you I say, never take for granted the absolute privilege and responsibility of possessing the awareness necessary to begin perceiving and Interacting with the many areas of our existence which have been so thoroughly hidden… this knowledge holds the key to any kind of hopeful future. The Power is in our hands, Individually and Collectively… we did not come to this point for no reason.

It is our responsibility to carefully,lovingly and with good intent, embody this knowledge and keep it alive… Constantly applying it to the conduct of our everyday lives… aiding those who we come across that are seeking this connection that is in whatever way required, to help seize that spark of Divinity within them and live the highest quality of life possible. Only when we mentally and spiritually rise above the system we found ourselves within, can we begin to see it for what it Truly is and begin to shape this reality into something beautiful.

In the concept of the self being illusory however, the information I have consumed has spoken of not being separate from the thoughts, feelings, and sensations, that rather than there being a separate ""I"" that experiences these thoughts and feelings, that we are one and the same thing and there therefore is no ""I"".

How can the idea of impartially observing thoughts and feelings as if you are an watching from the outside be reconciled with the idea of experiencing the realisation that the self is illusory when that seems to necessitate the exact opposite of that impartial and separated perspective?

We do this because we are divided. Our conscious, rational surface is divided from our unconscious emotional depths. We act out of intellectual conviction without successfully carrying the emotions with us. Or, we act out of the fullness of our emotions while our rational mind holds back. In either case we do not act totally, we do not act with the whole of ourselves, and therefore we do not really act.

We are not wholehearted in what we do. Matthew Arnold, more than a hundred years ago, spoke of \`our sick hurry, our divided aims' - and that just about describes the situation. We are in a hurry, a sick hurry, yet our aims are divided. We don’t really and truly do anything. We don’t do it with the whole force of our being. When we love, we don’t really love, and when we hate, we don’t really hate. We don’t even really think. We half-do all these things.

And it’s the same, only too often, when we take up the spiritual life. We meditate with only part of ourselves. We communicate with only part of ourselves, and we work, perhaps, only with part of ourselves. We commit to the spiritual life only with part of ourselves. And consequently, we don't get very far. We don’t really grow, we don’t really develop, we don’t carry the whole of our being along with us, so to speak. A small part of us is prospecting ahead, but the greater part is lagging far behind.

I have a question based on our own likes and dislikes. There are many spiritual teachings that claim that you should go beyond the standard like/dislike mindset. What bothers me about all of this is when I analyse it in depth. My own observation is that every single person is unique and that's what gives the life we know infinite richness. Take likes and dislikes away and make everyone indifferent about every single thing (music taste, clothes taste, food taste, movie taste) and you basically make a person lose a lot of their individuality. Everyone would be more or less the same, not following their inner nature. When I watch a movie I enjoy or when I see a move and think ""this is something I would probably find enjoyable"" and when it actually happens it feels my heart with joy and deep emotions. It is a lot more than just ""a mind connection"" to me. As with all other things I treasure things I'm naturally attracted to and magnetised with. Our likes and dislikes are also a guiding point, a compass if you will. Based on what you find fascinating, what sparks your soul, what you like - you'll make a decision on what kind of job you'll pursue / or education. Following my own insights on what you feel deep inside is to my liking and what isn't has brought me a lot of satisfaction in many areas of life: relationships/jobs/hobbies. I do not particularly agree with some masters advice that we should break free of all our likes and dislikes. It's what makes us unique, it's what separates us from other people. At core we are all one and whole, on the circumference there's immense uniqueness, individuality and variety and I do not think that's wrong. Everyone can't be a doctor and everyone can't be a poet. Someone will be a rock star and be amazing it while someone else will be a pop star and be amazing at it (they followed their likes and dislikes which led them to their profession). I am utterly convinced that likes and dislikes are not all bad. I think we shouldn't 100% limit ourself by them but we in a lot of instances we should definitely follow them. Another example: i will not a date drug addict or a smoker because i disliked drug addicted people. I am following my heart and look after myself and how something that I dislike would affect my life, etc. We should be all free to express our unique nature and follow it. Why should we not like something we immensely enjoy (particular music - that makes us feel unbelievable), and stay away from in this example music, that makes us feel nothing and we our ears recognise as bland - a dislike. 

I'd be glad to hear your opinion on this, i hope it is not too much of a bothersome read.

Some minds, depending on their vision, understand the eventual demise of the body, and questions; Why all this, why not nothing? What am I? Where do I go when I die? Where did I come from? Why do I suffer so much?

So, the mind begins searching for answers, tries to figure it out, but when the mind hits a dead end intellectually, it might try meditation as a last resort to perhaps shift its consciousness into a different realm. Some say that all the wisdom of the universe is within each of us; all we have to do is unlock it.

When mind embarks on meditation, it’s like trying to calm the heavy seas of a hurricane regarding these never-ending and seemingly concrete thoughts that populate the brain. With practice, however, the thoughts slow down.

When the mind becomes really still, it can observe how a self is created. It begins with a tiny spark in the brain that develops into an image. This image is then remembered. There is then a flipping back and forth between the image and memory as the image turns into an action movie. The original image, let’s say a picture of your body, is remembered.

There is a flipping between image, and memory of the image, many times within a nano second. This creates the illusion of something watching the drama that’s unfolding, even though it is only memory. There is no ‘self,’ just a continual sequence of image and memory, again and again.

As a result, it appears that a thought is being observed when really the observer is only memory, but so quickly that it appears to be an overview. In reality there is only one thought following another endlessly. It’ s all an illusion.

By watching these movies in meditation, the mind slowly sees into the essence of its own brain activity. Although in the beginning the mind thought that it was doing the thinking, it now thinks that thinking is merely a process that is conditioned by either a contact with a physical sense organ, or a contact with neurons. There is nothing magic about it. But yet there it is, So, from where does the initial stimulation of the brain inherently arise before it affects the physical?

**Deeper:**

It partially comes from what is termed the lifetime continuum consciousness, which is, in a way, the storage consciousness of past life kamma. This original spark then is joined by present consciousness which includes the current kamma (habit patterns) – the insight and wisdom along with the delusions and ignorance. Meditation is the tool to sort this all out, as intellectualizing is too analog, so to speak, instead of digital

So what underlies this creating of a self among in all this activity? What creates the observer – that which seems to oversee it all?

Meditation can understand this illusion, but not by logic. It understands it when the mind flips consciousness. This is experienced as a great relief and a load off the mind’s shoulders. As mediation progresses further, all traces of self, me, mine, I, or mind are transcended. This then is enlightenment, a “Blowing out of the flame,” as the Buddha put it. So where do we start?

We begin (and end) with the Five Aggregates. These Five Aggregates are everything we are, and are the fundamental building blocks of experience in Buddhism. They are:

Form (rupa): the physical body and all material phenomena

Feeling (vedana): pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral sensations

Perception (samjna): the mental process of recognizing and labeling objects

Mental formations (sankhara): all mental activities, including thoughts, emotions, and volitions

Consciousness (vijnana): the awareness of experience

Clinging aggregates (upadanakkhandha) are any of the five aggregates that we identify with or cling to as being ""me"" or ""mine.""

The aggregates are innocent in and of themselves, but it is the clinging to them by a self, manufactured by the aggregates, that gets us in trouble. This clinging is the root of suffering, according to Buddhism.

The difference between an aggregate and a clinging aggregate is that an aggregate is simply a component of experience, while a clinging aggregate is an aggregate that the mind has attached to or identified with.

For example, our physical body is an aggregate. It is a collection of cells, tissues, and organs that are constantly changing and impermanent. But when we identify with our body and believe that it is our permanent and unchanging self, then it becomes a clinging aggregate.

Similarly, our thoughts, feelings, and perceptions are all aggregates. But when we cling to them as being ""me"" or ""mine,"" then they become clinging aggregates.

The goal of Buddhist practice is to learn to see the five aggregates for what they really are: impermanent, impersonal, and subject to change. When we let go of our clinging to the aggregates, we can experience true liberation from suffering.

Here is an example to illustrate the difference:

Imagine that you are walking through a forest, and you see a beautiful butterfly. You admire its colorful wings and graceful flight. This is a simple experience of form.

But now imagine that you become attached to the butterfly. You want it to stay with you forever. You chase after it and try to catch it. But the butterfly is too quick for you. It flies away and you are left feeling disappointed and frustrated.

In this case, the butterfly has become a clinging aggregate. You have attached to it and identified with it as being something that you need or possess. When it flies away, you experience suffering.

The same thing can happen with any of the five aggregates. If we cling to them as being ""me"" or ""mine,"" then we will experience suffering when they change or disappear.

The Buddha goes on to say that the aggregates are not permanent or self-existent. They are constantly changing and arising and passing away. This is one of the key insights of Buddhism, and it is the foundation for the practice of meditation.

**A Different Realm**:

The act of dying brings up a clinging consciousness that craves existence and clings to a self. This consciousness then is the driver of rebirth as the consciousness of craving looks for a body to manifest its desires. The craving also carries with it the kamma that has accumulated though many lifetimes.

Although the self-illusion construction by the brain and mind ends at death, the power and impetus of the craving continues in a different realm as does the kamma. This alternate reality that houses the consciousness and kamma of rebirth possibly could be timeless and not within space, so is not normally comprehendible within our normal consciousness, but it’s real.

The illusion of self only exists as long as we are alive. Its desire to live at all costs is what propels it to be reborn. Since it is the illusory self that develops an identity and personality, these don’t continue after death, only the habits and inclinations (kamma) of the old self continue.

This is why Buddhism uses the word rebirth instead of reincarnation. Reincarnation hints at an identity being reborn, where rebirth indicates only habits and inclinations being reborn into a completely different identity.

Khemaka Sutta 22.89 “In the same way, friends, it’s not that I say ‘I am form,’ nor do I say ‘I am other than form.’ It’s not that I say, ‘I am feeling… perception… fabrications… consciousness,’ nor do I say, ‘I am something other than consciousness.’ With regard to these five clinging-aggregates, ‘I am’ has not been overcome, although I don’t assume that ‘I am this.’

“Friends, even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters, he still has with regard to the five clinging-aggregates a lingering residual ‘I am’ conceit, an ‘I am’ desire, an ‘I am’ obsession. But at a later time he keeps focusing on the phenomena of arising & passing away with regard to the five clinging-aggregates: ‘Such is form, such its origination, such its disappearance. Such is feeling.… Such is perception.… Such are fabrications.… Such is consciousness, such its origination, such its disappearance.’ As he keeps focusing on the arising & passing away of these five clinging-aggregates, the lingering residual ‘I am’ conceit, ‘I am’ desire, ‘I am’ obsession is fully obliterated.

“Just like a cloth, dirty & stained: Its owners give it over to a washerman, who scrubs it with salt earth or lye or cow-dung and then rinses it in clear water. Now even though the cloth is clean & spotless, it still has a lingering residual scent of salt earth or lye or cow-dung. The washerman gives it to the owners, the owners put it away in a scent-infused wicker hamper, and its lingering residual scent of salt earth, lye, or cow-dung is fully obliterated.

“In the same way, friends, even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters, he still has with regard to the five clinging-aggregates a lingering residual ‘I am’ conceit, an ‘I am’ desire, an ‘I am’ obsession. But at a later time he keeps focusing on arising & passing away with regard to the five clinging-aggregates: ‘Such is form, such its origination, such its disappearance. Such is feeling.… Such is perception.… Such are fabrications.… Such is consciousness, such its origination, such its disappearance.’ As he keeps focusing on the arising & passing away of these five clinging-aggregates, the lingering residual ‘I am’ conceit, ‘I am’ desire, ‘I am’ obsession is fully obliterated.”

**In Summary:**

Once anatta is experienced (not intellectualized) and stream entry is accomplished, there remains the aggregates to be navigated. If anatta is prematurely mistaken for enlightenment, then there can be conflict until enlightenment is truly experienced and one becomes an arahant, at which time the aggregates remain but no longer require navigation as they are no longer subject to clinging.

The difficulty lies in the premature assessment of enlightenment where delusion is still there but glossed over, until, of course, life blindsides us and we realize our folly.

In this case we might become confused as to what is responsible for actions, or how to make choices, and what is responsible for them? There can be emotional repercussions as well since we still attach to them.

The premature perceived absence of self can feel unsettling as well, and again glossed over. We often still seek meaning, purpose, and connection but might deny it subconsciously, which could set the aggregates up for conflict.

Ethical questions can become complex as well, for example how do we navigate moral choices and treat others compassionately unlike most of the natural world of insects and animals?

On our way to eventual stream entry and enlightenment, we can relax into our illusions take them for what they are, and as Ajahn Chah said,

*“The heart of the path is so simple. No need for long explanations. Give up clinging to love and hate, just rest with things as they are. This is all I do in my own practice.*

*Do not try to become anything. Do not make yourself into anything. Do not be a meditator. Do not become enlightened. When you sit, let it be. When you walk, let it be. Grasp at nothing. Resist nothing.*

*Of course, there are dozens of meditation techniques to develop samadhi and many kinds of vipassana. But it all comes back to this – just let it all be. Step over here where it is cool, out of the battle.”*

""People have a hard time letting go of their suffering. Out of a fear of the unknown, they prefer suffering that is familiar.”

Buddhists say that anytime we experience a negative event in our lives, two arrows fly our way. Being physically struck by an arrow is painful. Being struck by a second emotional arrow is even more painful (suffering). The Buddha explained, “In life, we can’t always control the first arrow. However, the second arrow is our reaction to the first. The second arrow is optional.”

You could be sitting in a coffee shop having a quarter-life existential crisis, completely stressed out of your mind about how you have no idea what you’re doing with your life when it seems like everyone else has theirs together, while the person next to you is happily enjoying their freshly brewed drink while peacefully people watching. You both are in the same exact coffee shop, smelling the same aroma, surrounded by the same strangers, but how the world looks to both of you couldn't be more different.

Two different people can be doing the exact same job but will have completely different experiences of that job. It can be the most amazing experience and a dream job for one person but be another person's worst nightmare and living hell. The only difference between one person and the other is how they think about their job, which determines how they ultimately feel about it.

Who would you be without that thought that you hated your job? Take 1 minute to see what comes up for you and don't move on until you do that. If you don't overthink it and truly let the answers surface from within you, without that thought, you will most likely feel and be happy, peaceful, free, and light. Without our usual thinking about a particular event or thing, our experience of it completely alters. This is how we live in a world of thought, not reality, and how our perception of reality is created from the inside out, through our own thinking. With this new understanding, you've just uncovered the cause of all our human psychological suffering...

“It’s not other people, situations, or circumstances. It’s not the empty boat, but my reaction to it that causes my anger. All the people or situations that make me upset and angry are just like the empty boat. They don’t have the power to make me angry without my own reaction.”

Your mind has done an amazing job at what it was made to do, but now you may relieve it of its job because we no longer live in the wild where death could be right around the corner in a bush.

What is a baby's natural and default state (assuming the baby wasn't abused, neglected, or had any physical issues)? Are babies naturally stressed, anxious, fearful, and self-conscious? Or are they naturally in a state of bliss, happiness, and love?

we are having a LOT of thinking going on. The strength of the negative emotion we feel is in direct proportion to how much thinking we are doing in the moment.

To see the truth in this, recall a few other memories you had when you were extremely stressed and anxious and see how much thinking was going on at the time. Take about 1-2 minutes to do this. Then recall a few memories where you were at your happiest or felt the most joy and love and see how much thinking you had going on at that time.

Therefore, it's not WHAT we're thinking about that is causing us suffering, but THAT we are thinking.


“If the only thing people learned was not to be afraid of their experience, that alone would change the world.”—Sydney Banks

we are working on allowing thoughts to come and flow through us while we minimize the thinking about those thoughts that emerge.

By us becoming aware that we are thinking and that it is the root cause of all our suffering, it automatically makes us conscious to that fact and we become detached to it, allowing it to settle and pass. This takes almost no effort and is done through pure presence in the moment.

All we have to do is remember it, know that this is just our thinking, and have peace knowing that the sun is not gone forever and that it will rise again soon enough.

In other words, the state of peak performance for humans can be described as the state of non-thinking.

Like everything in this world, there is nothing inherently good or bad, only our thinking makes it so. Goals,

All you have to do is become aware of that fact, which will settle the thinking just like the debris settling in dirty water. Once you see that it is just your thinking and that there’s nothing to be afraid of, then you will experience true peace in your life in the present.

we simply forgot where our experience comes from and that our thinking is the cause of our negative emotions. All you have to do is remember that thinking is the root cause of how we’re feeling.

“Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.”—Steve Jobs

When we’re in this state, miracles occur, such as business deals coming out of nowhere, people showing up at the right place at the right time, money coming in exactly when we need it, connections that we were looking for spontaneously falling upon our laps, and life seems almost magical. Time seems to warp and bend

This is not to say that we give up because we can’t control our lives, it’s quite the opposite. When we realize that we don’t have to control and try to force everything to happen our way, we become free from suffering, pain, and frustration and begin to fall into this state of non-thinking where things just all happen for us instead of to us.

We can decide to change our experience of life whenever we want and how we feel at any moment. This is how we can choose to be happy—by choosing to let go of our thinking. Isn’t that what ultimately matters at the end of the day? It’s not about what we have, but how we feel inside that is the true measure of success, joy, and fulfillment.

If you begin to feel like something’s wrong because you feel way too peaceful and content, know that it’s only your mind trying to make you think again. Your mind is the greatest salesman and knows exactly what to say to lure you back into its vicious cycle of destructive thinking.

“There will come a time when you believe everything is finished, that will be the beginning.”

We think because it is a biological response to survive. Our minds think only because it is trying to keep us alive, but it does not help us thrive. It is only concerned with our safety and survival, but not our fulfillment.

I've been practicing mindfulness to help stay grounded and present, really focusing on the here and now. It's been amazing for my mental clarity and stress levels.

     I love you. I love you so deeply, so truly, and so completely, that I find myself constantly analyzing how all my efforts fall so terribly short of adequately expressing the love I feel for you. That’s why I’m writing this letter; to try and use words to express some tiny piece of the ineffable love I hold within my spirit any time I sense you. And I sense you everywhere, in absolutely everything.

     When I say “I love you,” I don’t mean that I love your personality, or that I love the way you look, or that I feel pride when I reflect on your achievements or your unique life journey. The love I’m talking about goes deeper than any of those things. You could have a personality that looks just the polar opposite of the one you have now, and the love I feel wouldn’t be diminished by it in the slightest. You could look like a garbage bag full of ground beef (You don’t. You’re beautiful, I’m just illustrating a point) and I would love you just the same. You could go through your life in any manner you choose, making any decisions you choose, and this love I feel would radiate just as steadily regardless of what you did or didn’t do with your time here.

     The problem I have, is that I’m not sure how to show you this love. It feels impossible. Like, how could I—just a small, limited, deeply flawed person—how could I possibly express the beauty and the wonder you’ve caused to take root within my spirit, when the tools of expression I have are just as flawed and limited as I am? It seems impossible! But I’m going to try. Because you’re worth it. You’re worth everything.

     You.

     Not your body. Not your mind. Not your thoughts. Not your actions. I love all of these things about you of course, but I’m talking about something more.

     That something more is you. The real you. There’s a common thread that binds you—the fundamental nature of what you are—to everything else. To me. Have you felt that connection in your life? I hope you have. If you haven’t, it’s okay, you’ll see it in your own time, in your own way. I just want to tell you about it, because it’s such a warm, safe, and loving presence that permeates everything around you.

     And it’s you! You’re the one that’s making the magic!

     Do me a favor and sit with yourself for just a moment. Just sit, get comfy, fidget and fuss and settle your body. Then look to your breath. Let it spill out of you. Let it fall/flow/drift out of you just however it wants to, then let it spill back into you in just the same way. There’s no rhythm. It’s just you and your breath, and however you want to notice it.

     Then look to your body. You don’t have to seek out any sensation. You don’t have to do anything at all—that’s the wonderful thing about all this—just feel your body. Give it your attention and feel it respond joyfully to that attention. It wants you to notice it, just like everything else does. Feel the warmth of your pulse beating through you. The electricity of your energy buzzing through your fingers and toes. Feel the life within you.

     That’s what you are. That feeling. That power—that ever-present life that’s permeating you—is more than just your organism producing physical sensations to stimulate feedback to inform your basic survival mechanisms. It’s flow. It’s rhythm. It’s a breath of its own, and it’s falling in and out and up and down in just the same way you are. Feel it in the air around your head. Feel it in the cells dancing though your skin. Feel it in these few words as they appear on a page or a screen, and know that I feel the same breath that you do as I sit here and write this, regardless of any time or distance that appear to separate me writing this from you reading it. Because, as you’ll see when you look at and listen to the rhythm of life, there is no time or distance or anything else that can separate “you” from “I.”

     Does any of this make sense? Have I said anything that means anything at all? I’m honestly not sure, this stuff feels like it’s walking a tightrope between wisdom and gibberish. If this all sounds like woo-woo bullshit to you, that’s fine! That’s completely okay! It’s funny, isn’t it? It sounds silly! But even so, I feel truth within the silliness. All I’m saying, is that if you want to laugh at the ridiculousness of anything I’m saying, please feel absolutely free to. Find your rhythm in your own way, and if your path forward involves denying and mocking the things I say on these pages, then by god, laugh! Mock! Do whatever you need to do to, and I’ll be here all the while to validate and appreciate the unique way you dance through your life.

     But if you feel some truth about any of this resonate within you, then I beg you: explore that feeling. Go inwards. Look for that feeling of life/peace/connection/resonation within your own body and your own breath, and soon you may begin to see it in so many other things as well. You’ll start to feel your life in the external world—in things you used to see as “separate from yourself.” Take the time to connect to that feeling each day, and I promise you, the suffering of life will find its own rhythm, and you’ll no longer have to lose yourself in thoughts or worries about “this” or “that.”
     
     The secret is that there is no secret. You don’t have to do anything at all. It’s precisely in the doing of things that I lose that connection, personally. When I try to wrap my hands around life, it slips away. When I grow tired of it and try to push it away from me, it just floats around my hands and through my fingers, then drifts about from the ripples caused by my struggling, thoroughly unaffected by anything I tried to “do to it.” No matter how much I thrash and rage, no matter how much I seek and grasp, that life that I’m chasing or running from never gets closer or further away.

     It’s just always there. I only had to stop and look at it. Listen to it.

     I just had to open myself to the feeling of it. I just had to open myself to myself. And now I’m learning to love myself for the first time, because I’m realizing that it’s not “me” that I love. It never was. It never will be.

     It’s you.

     I love you. You. You are vast and magnificent. You are eternal and deep. You are power and energy. You are a unique expression of the infinite spacious conciseness that I feel all around me. And I want so terribly for you to see yourself as I do.

     It’s all only possible because of you. I am only me because of you! This is life, my love. At least as I see it in this moment. It’s rhythm and it’s breath. It’s love and its connection. It’s in and out, and it’s up and down. It’s black and white, light and dark, and this and that. It all reflects itself, contrasts itself, investigates itself, and plays games with itself. It’s everything you can imagine and more, and it all goes together, right along with that same breath falling in and out of you, even if you can’t see the connections from where you stand right now.

     Our breath is our bridge back to that center when we lose it—because make no mistake, you will lose it throughout your life, it’s what we do as human beings; we forget—it helps guide us back to the flow, integrating us into the harmony that we deafen ourselves to with our cacophonous torrents of runaway thoughts. It holds our hand and shows us that we didn’t need to be afraid or run around in a panic searching for meaning, it’s within us all the time.

     That’s what I want to be for you: a gentle, guiding hand that nurtures the innate kindness that blooms within your soul during moments of genuine connection. I realize that I will fail in this, at least to some extent, just as I realize that you will likely play this nurturing role for me more often than I play it for you. I’m sorry for that. I wish I was more complete and less flawed, but that’s why I’m here: to grow. It’s why we’re all here, I think, but now I’m getting off topic.

     During times of strife, try to remember the paradoxical nature of existence; light goes with darkness, life goes with death, up goes with down, good goes with bad, and “I” goes with “you.” These things all reflect each other. They all contrast each other and oppose each other from certain perspectives, but each one goes together despite how completely opposite they appear. Zoom out a bit in moments like this (or later on, when reflecting back on them) and see if you can’t spot the threads of connection even in the midst of chaos. You don’t have to come to some magic epiphany and suddenly understand the tapestry of connection and how each “bad” moment also implies a “good,” no … you don’t have to see anything special or secret, you just have to see that presence—that consciousness—is still there even in what you would call the worst of times.

     Picture waves on the surface of the ocean to be your thoughts and emotions and everything else that you’ve called “you” all these years, while the vast, unexplored depths all around your formation of waves is what “you” really are. Try to practice seeing the waves you make in the world as part of the ocean, and not separate things into themselves.

     I feel as though I’m rambling now, so I’ll try to wrap this up. I just love you. That’s all I really wanted to say here—that’s all I ever really want to say, I’m just not very good at saying it. God, do I love you with all of my being, and I’m so ecstatic to watch how you express your own love upon this existence. You are exquisite. You are fundamental.

     You just are.

&#x200B;

I remember days when the rain seemed never-ending, shrouding the city in a misty veil. Despite the dreary weather, I was struck by the resilience of the locals, who seemed unfazed by the constant deluge. One memory stands out vividly: a rainy Christmas spent exploring a botanic garden with friends. Despite the weather, the garden was teeming with visitors, and a passing stranger remarked with a smile, “This is Vancouver; you do everything in the rain.”

&#x200B;

At the time, I couldn’t comprehend their unwavering optimism. But as I delved deeper into my spiritual journey, I began to understand. Vancouver wasn’t just a city; it was a sanctuary for spiritual growth. For me, spirituality is all about nurturing a strong inner self, so that external circumstances no longer have the power to easily sway us.

&#x200B;

It wasn’t until I left Vancouver that I truly appreciated the transformative impact it had on my life. Those four years weren’t just a chapter; they were a journey of self-discovery that brought me closer to my spiritual core and inspired me to share my newfound wisdom with others.

&#x200B;

Among the many lessons I’ve learned, one practice stands out: the power of emotional healing. While conventional wisdom urged me to change my thoughts or behaviors, I found true liberation through confronting and releasing my deepest emotions. By allowing myself to fully experience and process my feelings, I discovered a profound sense of peace and authenticity.

&#x200B;

Now, when I reflect on the metaphor of dancing in the rain, I see it as an embodiment of emotional resilience. Just as we cannot control the weather, we cannot always control our emotions. Yet, by facing our inner storms head-on and embracing the discomfort, we pave the way for growth and transformation. Avoidance only prolongs the downpour; true liberation comes from dancing fearlessly in the rain, knowing that the sun will eventually break through the clouds.

When I meditate I focus on sensations of breath inside the walls of  my nostrils; then after some time (sometimes is 1-2 seconds, other times  is 5-6 seconds) I get distracted and start having random thoughts,  like:   

\-Saying with my internal voice ""This is so boring"" or ""I have to buy  veggies tomorrow morning"" or ""Fuck, I forgot my friend's birthday last  week"" etc   

\-Picturing (so visualizing) memories about dialogues, events,  experiences I had, sometimes reconstructing them with imaginary  dialogues, rethinking how could I have answered better etc   

\-Having sexual thoughts about a porn video I like, or a girl I wish I had sex with etc ending up sexually aroused   

\-Feeling emotionally sad, or relaxed, or calm, or overwrought etc   

When I notice these verbal and visual thoughts, emotions and  feelings, body reactions and sensations, I try to bring back my  attention to the sensations of breath in the nostrils.   

 But I feel I'm doing something wrong because it feels like I'm only  training my concentration, my ability to focus, like if I'm hitting  myself with a stick to refocus on something particular after getting  distracted.

\-Developing awareness series-

The ability to consistently pick up on patterns, synchronicities and the hidden meanings behind every moment in life, is in fact a particular degree of extra sensory perception/Clairvoyance (which literally translates to “clear seeing”). This is more than often one of the first levels of E.s.p that one develops upon their Initial awakening.

When this faculty begins to strengthen within the individual, it greatly enhances their awareness… making them hyper-vigilant of not only what’s going on within themselves, but also of the many things happening all around them in daily life which they usually “look past”. Learning to tap into this ability can lead one to much insight… enabling them to read circumstances in life, like an open book… extracting knowledge from any given situation. In a sense this is the source of all divination, as it were originally without any objects (runes, cards etc.).

Synchronicity in particular is a very intimate and personal phenomena, seeing as the significance of the occurrence is specifically related to something that our own individual, Internal awareness has picked up on and then further recognized outwardly as an External pattern or relevance… and because this is the case, the insights/lessons that can be gained from these synchronicities, serve as opportunities to gain a more in depth understanding of our own nature.

Synchronicity is the “place” where mind meets matter, I like to describe it as “Internal relevance followed by external correlation (as in correlated to the internal relevance), which results in some kind of personal affirmation”. Getting familiar with this faculty lets One get used to working with the complex nature of extra sensory perception, which down the road will lead to more advanced degrees of clairvoyance and more in-depth insights into their everyday life, with the development of an increasingly efficient form of Inner-Communication…

There is a seeping of resistance to life.
To the existing moment.

Since in the past the moment was a suffering

So we avoid encountering the moment

In order not to collide again with negativity

And a screen is created, a veil of disconnection
In front of the moment.

And thus, even if there is a positive encounter

It is swallowed by the barrier veil

And the personality inside, thinking it is protected

Actually, nothing enters it.

So, it probably empties itself from energy. 

Unless a narrow opening is made.

Into which surely arrive various narcissistic invaders
Such and others. 

Or loved ones who allow such an opening.

Everything that one thinks one is that in any way that has a form or structure, be it physical or conceptual, is conditioned and only ever partially under personal control at best, only ever relatively self. What you have you will lose at some point or it will change in a way you do not want, and things you don't want to experience, you will have to experience at some point. This is because it is ultimately not you and it is not ultimately under your control, only relatively and temporarily. Ultimately, it is a product of conditions beyond self and it acts according to those conditions. When conditions change, it changes, and one cannot stop this happening although one might be able to mitigate it to some degree and for a limited amount of time.

Present moment awareness is freedom from the conditioned.

The body and mind, relationships and possessions cannot ultimately be saved as they are products of conditions that change, which are themselves products of other conditions that change, and so on, ad infinitum. The present moment awareness does not need saving as it is not affected by conditions, from the first person, experiential perspective, which is the only one that can be verified directly through experience. Present moment awareness is just aware of what is currently, and in this way it is pure, and cannot be stained as it is always just aware of what currently is. When abiding on the level of present moment awareness of what simply is occurring in the senses and mind (the field of awareness) in the very moment, it is obvious how ephemeral sense contacts are, how they come, change and go constantly and there is no lasting self or substance in them. Thus, there is no attachment and clinging on this level, and this is why it is freedom from the conditioned.

Of course one should do one's best in one's life and try to succeed, but one will never have full or lasting control over one's life, as it is ultimately a product of conditions beyond it, therefore it is important to realize that there is the sanctuary from the conditioned which is accessible to everyone, which is present moment awareness.",False,Present Moment Awareness is Freedom From the Conditioned,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/1b5jngr/present_moment_awareness_is_freedom_from_the/

**Addiction in depth-**

**We live in an age where drug addiction and addiction in general, have become an absolute epidemic… and because of this, it is crucially important for us to understand what addiction is on a deeper level, perhaps now more than ever…**

**Here at old soul philosophy, we take a very different approach to addiction… like everything else, we address it at all levels of manifestation… Spiritually, psychologically and physically. No matter what kind of addiction, whether it be to drugs, money, power, eating, cigarettes or any other kind… by addressing it at the source, internally, we have the greatest potential for growth… also for overall perspective as far as addiction and its different degrees of manifestation go. When an individual comes to comprehend how addiction manifests at the spiritual and psychological levels, they can then apply that fundamental understanding to most any addiction they come across, both personally and in others… Substituting different variables based on the type of addiction of course.**

**In this article we will begin with drug addiction specifically, which starts with a basic understanding of how these different substances effect our nature… again, at all levels of our existence.**

**Every “drug” contains within its essence a very particular resonance… When we consume this substance and take it into our being, our energy field begins to reflect this resonance… Causing some kind of internal state or condition dependent upon the drug at hand… These different internal states or conditions act as “preferable environments” for multitudes of entities which are of like nature to its energy… entities both internal (bringing aspects of our unconscious to the surface) and “external” (Attracting beings who resonate with the substance ingested).**

**It is also important to understand that when our internal resonance changes, be it due to drugs or any other reason, so do the emotions (energies) and thought entities coming into our “heads” … which is the factor that determines the nature of our actions and behavior at any given moment. If one remains self-observant even while under the influence, they will notice this happen through a shift in their thought process... whatever energy is active within us in that state, will start manifesting as associated thoughts via thought entities. Different moods (internal conditions) and or drug induced states, allow that part of ourselves which resonates with them, to enter the “driver seat” of our vessel … whether “beneficial” or “unbeneficial” to our situation.**

**Any and all drugs, once ingested, do indeed tap the individual into spiritual energies of which they do not normally experience to such an obvious degree… However, substances of a more “serious nature” hold much more potential for susceptibility towards unbeneficial entities/energies which manifest in many negative ways.**

**For example, psychedelics in general can be an incredibly helpful tool in one’s spiritual awakening in terms of developing clairvoyance and opening one up to receive channeled information… For the most part these kinds of substances tap one into a very natural, “playful” and knowledge-based kind of energy… or even “bad trips” which more than often result in some kind of internal growth and or a gaining of perspective towards one’s internal nature.**

**Whereas hard stimulants like Crack, coke and amphetamines… If not taken in moderation and with proper precautions, create a very uneasy and “hard to manage” internal environment within the individual… Which makes them susceptible to things like violence, paranoia and extreme unjustified sexual desires… Depending upon the individual’s internal nature, will power and the drug at hand…**

**That concludes part one of “Addiction in depth” …**

The suttas say that one practices Satipathana *“having put away covetousness and grief for the world,”* a ‘wretched and misleading’ translation by Professor Davis. But it stuck. “This misleading translation is the main reason why modern Western Buddhists misunderstand the instruction manual and find satipathana not working for them.”

The phrase, consistent with the pali phrases throughout the Pali Canon, actually translates as, *“having temporarily abandoned the five hindrances.”*  This takes Professor Davis’ rendering, which is meaningless in practical terms, to be the reason the satipathana sutta doesn’t work for Western Buddhists. They are missing the first, preliminary step – abandoning all five hindrances.

Why is this important? It’s important because without this instruction, “having temporarily abandoned the five hindrances” the Buddha’s proclamation that “If anyone should develop the satipathana *in such a way* for seven days, then they would realize either full enlightenment or the stage of non-returner. *In such a way* here implies the correct translation of *having temporarily abandoned the five hindrances* as a prerequisite to practicing the satipathana sutta. Without this qualification, the practice would not bear fruit and the promise of 7 days would be hollow.

So, the hindrances must be temporarily abandoned before practicing satipathana if good results are expected. And what is the only practice that guarantees this? The eighth step of the Eightfold path, *jhanas*, which is why this 8th step of the Path is so critical. It is so important that some teachers, such as Pa Auk whose monks have been very successful, teaches that the first 4 jhanas are required before even embarking on satipathana. And Ajahn Brahm’s meditation retreat center in Australia is named, “Jhana Grove.”

So what makes jhanas so special regarding ending the hindrances temporarily? As Ajahn Brahm says, “When you know the difference between power mindfulness (resulting from jhana and the temporary ending of the hindrances) and weak mindfulness as a personal experience, not a mere idea, then you will understand the necessity for jhana prior to satipathana.",False,Meditators Struggling Because of What Happened Over 100 Years Ago?,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/1b51ceq/meditators_struggling_because_of_what_happened/

He explains further that the Eightfold Path was to be found in the “Tens” chapter because the Buddha had added two extra factors – “Right (or perfect) Wisdom, and Right Liberation. The first eight Factors of the Path refer to the practice that one does, and the last two extra factors refer to the goal. Thus, the Eightfold path teaches ‘the way,’ together with the destination.

What is interesting here is how these two additional factors assist in explaining the importance of the interaction between the mindfulness and concentration factors, that is many times considered to be one or the other type of separate practice – Samatha or Vipassana.

Having a ninth Factor (perfect Wisdom) included in the Path that is dependent on each step of the path and eventually heavily dependent on the 7th and 8th steps for insight, reinforces the need to use steps 7 and 8 in a cooperative nature.

Regarding perfect wisdom, Ajahn Brahm says, “Deep insight refers to perfect wisdom. As the Anguttara texts make plain, deep insight, perfect wisdom is not possible without jhana (the eighth step of the Eightfold Path). Furthermore, the inevitable consequence of deep insight is perfect liberation, in other words, enlightenment.”

If we consider the Satipathana Sutta as the guide for the 7th step of the Eightfold Path, Mindfulness, then the Satipathana Sutta is joined at the hip with the 8th step, the jhanas.

Here is how Ajahn Brahm puts it, “The Buddha taught two types of satipathana. The first type is supported by jhana and leads to enlightenment in a short time. The second type, without jhana, produces valuable insights, especially ones that enable you to let go and come closer to jhana, but does not lead to enlightenment. Both types are found in the suttas.”

Ajahn Brahm then goes on (page 105) to explain the first type that leads to enlightenment, and why due to translation, many westerners get stuck on the satipathana sutta and make little progress.

To sum it up, there are two steps that the Buddha added to the Eightfold Path – Right Wisdom and Right Liberation. Right wisdom requires all eight steps of the Eightfold Path, and especially cooperative effort between the 7th and 8th steps in order for right liberation or enlightenment to happen.

As Ajahn Brahm explains, beginning with page 105 of his book; the satipathana, and mindfulness in general, will not take hold without first totally abandoning the five hindrances, which basically means dwelling in jhana which guarantees the end of the hindrances during meditation.

It has been my experience that separate jhana and satipathana practice is necessary due to the nature of jhanas where the mind is completely absorbed for long periods. Right after coming out of jhana, when the mind is pliable and shifted in consciousness, that is when satipathana practice bears the most fruit.",False,The Eightfold Path – Plus Two,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/1b44kg8/the_eightfold_path_plus_two/

The truth is I have no one in my life I feel like sharing these thoughts with, and writing them down for people to see often offers me some respite. I'm sharing this because I wish that others who are going through something similar, or has gone through something like it in the past, may share their insights around the issue. I'd love to hear it.  

It's going to be a long post.

This is my own story and reflections around coping with jealousy, sorrow and bitterness. 

I saw my ex on a dating app yesterday, and it crushed me. We broke up 9 months ago. We were together for 7 years prior. We got together very early, maybe too early, when we were 20 years old. We cared deeply about each other, but a mix of uncertainty, personal desires, differences in being employed/student, and living together/living apart, led us to compromise our relationship in a very bad way. 

We agreed to allow each other to make out with other people to alleviate some of the experiences we felt we missed out on during our years together. This desire mainly came from me, but once I had the opportunity, I felt satiated and no desire to indulge in it. A classic ""The thrill is the chase"". One night however, she went further than what we agreed upon with a person at a work party. There were no feelings involved, but she went too far and felt horrible about it. That same weekend I had begun feeling that I valued our relationship more than anything and wanted to affirm that she meant everything to me, and experimenting with others wasn’t important as long as we had each other. She confessed what she did with remorse, but it utterly crushed me. I literally realized what truly mattered to me when it was too late. This thought is hard to bear sometimes. 

The six months following the affair, we tried to salvage the relationship, and in a way we grew closer than ever. But the incident stung me badly, and its been one of the most difficult periods in my life. It was a period mixed with anger, a sense of betrayal, and shame of my selfish desires that led us down this path. I ultimately felt I couldn’t go on, because the relationship began to bring me so much pain, and a voice inside me screamed that the best thing to do is to end it, and so I did. It devastated us both, because I loved her, and I still do. And I think she feels the same still. She’s not only my first love, but she’s also the best friend I’ve ever had. It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. 

The period after the breakup has been one of inner reflection, improving myself mentally and physically. I stopped watching pornography all together, and have faced some trauma from my past with therapy. I've focused hard on my studies and laying the groundwork for a good career. I have still thought about her every day since the breakup, and although my feelings for her hasn’t vanished, they’ve been somewhat muted.

Now we arrive at the present day. I’ve been casually browsing on dating apps, made some casual chats, but I’m not in a position to date yet because I currently live at home and finishing my exams. At this time I just don’t feel like the kind of guy a woman wants to date. It's undoubtedly a dumb idea to browse dating apps in my situation, but sometimes its hard to not to allow ones self to curiously look at whats out there. It's exciting in a way, even though it's not the time for me.  I'm just a human after all.

Yesterday I saw her on the app. In a way I was so happy just to see her face again, but when the context dawned on me, my mood turned.  She looked great, but presented herself in a rather promiscuous way and tagged herself under “short term relationship”. I know what that means, she’s going out there to have casual hookups. She’s in her every right to do so, it’s her life and I respect her.  I've had my desires and want to indulge in them, and she's had hers too. I accept that. Given the current dating market I also know she's going to have a lot of options coming her way.

&#x200B;

This is where I express what I feel:

I can’t suppress my feelings of both jealousy that other men will now desire the woman I love, and bitterness that one of the primary reasons our relationship failed, casual hookups, is something that’s so readily available for her, but not for me, given the current state of dating. The irony is that I was the one who initially had the greatest desire to hookup with others, but now that I’m single, I’m left with almost no opportunities, while she has the opportunity to browse for several potential sexual partners. I try to to accept that life isn’t fair and not to be too bitter over this disparity. I have moments where I accept that the dating scene is tough for both men and women, and moments of anger, jealousy, and a sense of unfairness over my own situation. 

Again, I'm in no position to date yet, and I know I may sound unfairly prejudgemental over what I'm going to face in the modern dating world.  Still, I pick up stories and experiences from friends and societal discussions around the issues men face during dating. I try not to let this cloud my judgement too much, but I can't just ignore that I'm going to go out into something which isn't rigged for me.  


I find myself daydream a lot, that we will find our way together again, but I'm having problems accepting a scenario where she will have fulfilled her desires for casual hookups, and I won't. It's selfish, and I try to tell myself loudly that I'm good enough and I will have fun too, its just not the time for me yet.

 I feel like this rambling is taking so many directions now, so I'll end it here. Thanks for reading, I hope I communicated my thoughts in a somewhat clear way. Whatever you'd like to comment, I'll read and reply.

My mind is chock-full of thoughts all day, most of which are low-quality and meaningless. It’s amazing. 

I was recently laid off after working for decades at one organization. Thankfully, I was hired by another company six days later, but before that, I was barraged by mood swings and all sorts of thoughts. It was the most trying time of my life, and I don't know how I would have survived without my practice.

I had a firsthand look at my thoughts and was disturbed by how external sources like streaming media, internet surfing, and picking up the phone when bored were pervasively causing me pain and suffering by keeping me from being in the moment and mindful.

I’m realizing that I don’t need ANY electronic entertainment. Every screen is a distraction from the present moment to which I've become more attuned. I’m not some enlightened dude, it’s just that…wow this stuff is dangerous for the mind!

It's not that technology is bad; it just seems like our minds can't cope with the information overload and the draw of picking up the phone, opening the laptop, or turning on the TV instead of just sitting contentedly with our own thoughts, watching them come and go.

It’s valuable and I work with technology but I’m wondering if humanity is going to be able to handle it.

The three people I see the most day to day: my two in-room coworkers and my roommate, are all extremely anxious and constantly negative people. When in the office, I find it difficult to get work done due to how much my coworkers are constantly venting about their overwhelmed states, they are constantly battling the ""what ifs"" of potential things going wrong. They will also actively derail me from my tasks to vent and make me forget what I was doing, which costs a lot of time cumulatively. I do feel a great deal of compassion for them, however it is a rather harmful environment for me mentally. 

My roommate is a good person who I have known for years, but he is also someone without a long list of coping mechanisms other than ""come home and vent"". I will frequently come back to my apartment after a long day and be greeted by a despondent sigh and hearing all about the frustrations of his day, and also end up cleaning up after him because his anxiety sometimes occludes him from remembering to do so for himself. He is also constantly complaining about the things wrong with the apartment without really taking action about them, and frequently does that anxiety thing of asking me, a person who has all of the same information as him about something, to give him answers about it, sometimes very intensely. Cohabitating is never perfect, but right now I feel as though I am expected to be emotionally available to the people at home and at work, and also be the one who gets the most done at home and at work.

I know that neither of these situations will be forever, but right now it feels like my presence-of-mind development has outpaced my current living and working situation. Everything in my body is basically telling me ""move on, find a better situation"" but I have a lease that I don't want to break. I am actively looking for a job that will get me closer to nature once my lease is over, and hopefully will make some more authentic connections through that, and I know that won't be living with my current roommate next year. Some days there is just some difficulty in remembering that this will pass, and that I should try to appreciate the good things about what my life has going for me now.

I have no idea why, so I am trying to observe how it goes and to dig a bit to the topics that might be the cause of it. So I came here.

I will try to not make it too long. I have been on a trip to Spain for almost a month and took ""the power of now"" with me with the intention to make this trip my ""spiritual awakening"" turning point. Might sound stupid and I did not really believe anything would happen to make me feel different than before. But after reading it for a bit, something just switched in my brain and I felt happier and appreciating the beauty and people around me more. But like not in an intense, crazy, life-changing, ""I have reached nirvana"" kind of way. I just did not think about the past and future as much and could appreciate the sunsets and stuff more. A LOT of amazing things happened to me during that month and I can confidently say that it was the best month of my life. So I guess I was just more mindful with a more positive attitude towards everything. 

And now I came back. Feels a bit weird to back in general, after trips I often feel a bit detached from them and everything that happened. Yesterday I went out for the first time since my trip and... Everything is do different... The world feels light and soft and the words from myself and others just flow and everything feels easy and soft and in a way perfect, so that it feels like a movie. The sounds seem louder and I notice how my clothes and my body feels. And people are WAY MORE INCREDIBLE than I remember. I talk to them and it seems like everything is so raw and that some barrier or a wall is missing. Idk. Feels like it's all a simulation.

I have no idea. I don't think that is just mindfulles. I did not intentionally put effort into that these recent days. But it felt like from what I heard about being mindful. I felt like I was on drugs. Something is different and I do not understant if it is the world or my brain. This whole things is overwhelming. I am not sure if it is a good thing or bad. I also feel sleepier than usual, I have more thoughts that I find kind of witty or funny and I am confused a lot. I can't quite wrap my head around most social interactions.

I have been also drinking coffee everyday for the past few weeks, which I haven't ever done before (I mean have not drank it every day) Don't know if it's crazy, but maybe it is affecting me in strange ways. This change makes me worried. Like, maybe that is a symptom of some kind of gas poisoning or alien obduction (see, I wouldn't have thought to write something like that a few weeks ago). Today I stayed at home, so the whole thing wasn't as intense, but I still felt weird, a bit confused and the food tasted intense.

Some say suffering stems from ignorance.&nbsp; Others say ignorance is bliss.&nbsp; Some say suffering is from trying to control the outcome.&nbsp; Others say suffering is from lack of movement toward better outcome.&nbsp; As it turns out, all four of these descriptions are correct -- and at that, without contradiction.

Human suffering, in the most meaningful sense, is a mental state involving significant cognitive dissonance without outlet.&nbsp; *Cognitive dissonance* is the name given to internal contradiction between (a) perceived situation, (b) existing understanding, and or (c) current preference.&nbsp; Any disagreement between these creates dissonance.&nbsp; But perhaps only when the stress from said dissonance exceeds optimal stress level (per the Yerkes-Dodson model) does that dissonance experientially constitute meaningful suffering.&nbsp; In simple terms, suffering is the presence of apparent contradiction.&nbsp; But there's a catch: suffering *goes away* when the body *or mind* begins moving toward believed resolve.&nbsp; So in more precise terms, **suffering is the presence of apparent contradiction** ***without a believable path toward resolve.***

Now, on the matter of paths toward resolve, we have two: physical and mental.&nbsp; Obviously actually moving along what is believed to be a successful path toward resolve brings a feeling of relief.&nbsp; This is partly because there is no longer the same distressful rumination about how to settle the contradiction.&nbsp; Furthermore, this literal seeking behaviour often comes with increased energy, perhaps via increased dopamine.&nbsp; The resulting experience could even be described as having ""a sense of meaning"", in that *meaning is what moves us.*

But let us not forget the other path -- the mental.&nbsp; Sometimes when a person has a lot of dissonance, that person has a tendency to go on and on, *talking* incessantly, perhaps even in circles.&nbsp; Some might even proclaim said person ""likes to hear themselves talk"".&nbsp; The thing is, this is partly true.&nbsp; The very act of thinking or speaking is a type of ""movement"" that temporarily alleviates the pain of cognitive dissonance.&nbsp; And the more believed that motion is to resolve the underlying contradiction, the better that motion quells the suffering.

Coming back to the four popular statements about suffering:

1. Contradiction without outlet is the result of ignorance (of known outlet);&nbsp; so yes, suffering stems from ignorance.
2. *Unseen* contradiction cannot directly bring cognitive dissonance;&nbsp; so yes, ignorance (of contradiction) is bliss.
3. Trying to control what cannot be controlled is inherently contradictory;&nbsp; so yes, trying to control the (uncontrollable) outcome is cause for suffering.
4. Moving toward believed resolve -- whether physically, verbally, or mentally -- disables the pain of dissonance;&nbsp; so yes, suffering is the result of lacking motion or outlet.

# Summary

Putting it all together, human suffering is what happens when there is apparent contradiction between perception, understanding, and or preference -- without a trusted direction of resolve.&nbsp; Relieving suffering is thus a matter of identifying contradiction, understanding its nature, and finding a promising path forward.&nbsp; At that point, all it takes is embracing the unknown.&nbsp; The outcome may not truly be for deciding, but faith in the movement is enough to feel the freedom.",False,Suffering is the presence of contradiction without a trusted path forward,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/1b2xg3w/suffering_is_the_presence_of_contradiction/

What's weird is that i find the most relief from the pressure i was talking about when i actively deal with some thoughts, which is a bit counter intuitive to what i would think how i should handle this.

Sure, this way brings its own challenges, like I could see how I could get flooded with thoughts now that I opened that gate again, but this could still be managed and calmed down by meditation practices. I'm still doubtful of my way, but I try not to be. 

Would you say i'm onto something or is this just another illusion of a way that'd make me feel better?

**True value-**

In my experience, one of the most crucial lessons one should learn early on in order to further their spiritual development, is that of true value…, this is particularly important seeing as we live in a largely materialistic world. The idea that money is value is a spiritually diminishing mindset that has been programmed into the worlds populace for a very long time now, money is only of any “value” at all because the system that is in play on this planet, makes it so we cannot survive without it… and this is of course very intentional.

We are forced to spend so much time worrying about money, that we have hardly any time at all to do anything beneficial for ourselves such as develop as a spirit or even just to realize that the state of the world is not at all what we think it is. Anything that is truly valuable, is slowly weened out of our lives or limited so much that we can hardly enjoy it or take from it anything of true value. Sayings such as “money makes the world go round” are subconscious “architects” who further build upon and solidify the negative mental constructs that we are fed through psychological programming from every direction.

In my time learning to manifest, I discovered that once you learn to “see through the money” and call it out for what it really is, which is just a piece of paper that is made out to be “god” when it's not at all…, once you realize this, then there is a sort of respect gained from the universe and higher self…, making it much easier to manifest money/wealth, from having a much more in depth understanding of what value truly is (something I have experienced with great clarity).

Let us not forget the things in life that are of pure and true value. Things such as Love, respect and the urge to better ourselves, others and the world…, these amongst the many other truly valuable parts of life which bring us growth, love and balance. Do not let yourself struggle due to lack of money, but at the same time do not put it on a pedestal…, remember that money and value are two very different things.

To me it shows how the more assumptions you make in life the further you get removed from the way things really are. Removed from true experience of whatever you can be aware of, your surroundings and your internal world. Because there is no shortcut to it other than direct experience. 

It's showing the importance of being present and mindful in daily life because the proof is in the pudding as they say (hopefully I'm not misinterpreting that saying here). It's a little like saying water is wet and it may be a little mundane to some but let me explain.


Kastrup is a computer scientist and philosopher and is talking about free will in this episode. I just heard it while listening to a Weekend University podcast episode. He explains how a system that predicts stuff has to be more complex than the thing it predicts. (The system is determined to do things a certain way and that is essentially its will but that's not the point here.)

There's just no way to get everything right because we are not at all more complex than all of our surroundings. A complex computer might calculate the trajectory of a simpler projectile but I'm not an expensive computer and surely don't encompass all variables of everyone and everything else around me.

We do have a great number of variables and need to do our calculations of course. But the point is to be flexible. 

So when you're in thought all day trying to solve problems in your head, and trying to predict the day and all the things that could go wrong, remind yourself it's completely okay to just be present. Because we aren't any more complex than our entire combined environment. 


For some, like me, something like planning a party is a tough nut to crack. We run in place for miles without ever doing anything. 

So when you've solved the problem or when you feel you're going in a loop up there in your mind, feel free to come back and join (experience) the party with the rest of us.

After all the reason we go to parties is not to worry but to party. Our intention to party is like input in the system of a party, creating output for others at the party and keep it going. We are not more complex than the party, just bits in the system. 

Our ones or zeros, the vibe we carry to the party, the intention to party or to worry, impacts the rest of the party system. 

Essentially creating the output or the state of the party system that we desire. Welcome to the party planet!",False,Shortcuts only exist if you make simplifying assumptions,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/1b22yie/shortcuts_only_exist_if_you_make_simplifying/

But for a few reasons, most of them regarding my bf’s family (toxic, alcoholic, etc) I have been suffering a lot, specially seeing him suffer and because we are not able to move to another place (i dont live with him but i spend my weekends there). 

I want to not feel like that. I want to… maybe not enjoy the present? But not hate it, and not hate that situation? I don’t want to hate my life (or that part of my life).

The problem ist that it's and endless treadmill, i never arrive at anything and at night it's even harder to turn off, unless i'd get out of bed and distract myself, which i would want to avoid.

It is simply move in attention from your thoughts to your experiences. Instead of the repetitive loop of thoughts responding to thoughts responding to thoughts, you notice what is happening outside of ""you"". Once that happens, there is no where else to go but where you are. Trying to go further than your experience leads right back into the loop of thoughts. 

It doesn't mean that what you are experiencing outside of the loop of thoughts is necessarily pleasant.  You may be in a stressful job setting, or dealing with an ongoing personal issue. All a mindful perspective does is rescue you from the thought loops which make those situations even worse. 

For people who want to quit drinking or using drugs, a common mantra is that quitting won't solve your problems, but not quitting will certainly make them worse. It is the same with a mindful perspective. It does not change what is happening in your experience. It does gives you the opportunity to respond to whatever is happening with a mind free from the stress of grasping and aversion in your thought. Grasping is when you try to hold onto something good, even though we know that everything changes in a way that we do not control. Aversion is trying to push away something bad, and in doing so we give it more space and time in our mind than if we simply allowed it to dissipate, as all things do. 

It also does not mean that you can't do things you like and not do things you don't like. Grasping and aversion are thought processes, not methods of action. We can avoid a grasping mind while still pursuing something that makes us happy, like ordering ice cream, we just have the mental flexibility to not become enraged if we accidentally drop it on the ground. Same thing with aversion. We can actively avoid pain in our daily lives without mentally panicking whenever the thought of pain arises. We can live in this space if we allow ourselves to stop looking for something more in our experience than is actually there. 

Today, try to allow yourself to stop searching after that small move in attention. Give yourself permission to not go down the path of looking for something ""more"" than what is happening.

**For even these realms of experience, like all else that we know, are based upon some foundational essence of Truth… the determining factor standing between deception and Insight, is the Intuitive Discernment that comes along with a Dedicated Path of Awakening… which instills one with a certain “vigilance” when it comes to reading symbolism and communications from their Higher Nature within any given moment, as well as an ability to recognize patterns and reoccurring concepts within life and within Esoteric knowledge specifically.**

**A great example of this would be the tv and movies that we watch… For the average, largely unaware Individual, these sources of input act as Spiritual and psychological traps in the form of strategically misconveyed concepts, which manifest as unbeneficial understandings within their conscious and subconscious mind… inevitably serving an agenda that is set on sustaining their Ignorant state.**

**However, for the Student of Esoteric Knowledge and Symbolism… this very same kind of media-based input can be a goldmine of Information and Insight into the MANY blatant Esoteric Truths that are Present, as well as hints into different behind the Scenes “goings on” that relate directly to mass Ignorance and its implementation… that and much more of course.**

**These symbolic and often flat-out pieces of Information are present within these movies, shows and other media for a reason… because those behind their production, are well aware of these things… and they are also well aware that the mass majority of people, will miss it and let it go right over their heads due to a lack of awareness, and by doing so, actively give their consent to the “Powers that be” which suppress this knowledge for their own purpose… By missing the many direct hints, they can say “Well you can’t say we didn’t tell you” … which is not only a big slap in the face being that they are the reason the majority will miss it in the first place, but this is also their way of applying Natural Law in order to avoid Karmic Repercussions for their Deception… They “trick” people into doing it to themselves, so they don’t have to… in endlessly diabolical ways.**

**But being that The Student of Esoteric Knowledge is Aware of many of these factors, and embodying a very real degree of Intuitive Discernment, they are able to utilize for their own growth and development, a factor which results in quite the opposite for most… This is just one example of MANY pertaining to how the Individual who possesses a sufficient degree of discernment can make use of even the areas of life which aim to hold us back.**

I know everything is not as easy as shown on social media. We never show the downfall there. So it feels like everything is sorted out, but again, there are general things where we can be sure that they are excelling or doing better than us.

Now I also know that everyone's life is different. We all have our own pace and luck, but I find myself not being able to accept this fact. I mean, there are people out there who are having a better life than us. But at the same time, there are people out there who would be happy if they got an opportunity to be in my shoes. But still, I am having a hard time accepting this fact and always get sad thinking about my life and comparing myself to others. We are humans, and it is our tendency to compare.

I felt like this would be the right place to post this :)

I am working on an app that is centered around tea and mindfulness called Tea Ami. I have launched a very early stage version of it on App Store and google play and would love to hear some feedback from people who are into both tea and mindfulness! 

This is not an attempt to promote this app but just truly would like feedback from people!

I appreciate any feedback and of course there is no pressure to download! All feedback is insightful, negative or positive!

There are also some features such as a tea database so you can find which teas can have what flavors/effects, as well as a tea recommender, based on your preferences you input!

Here are the links:

**When it comes to traumatic circumstances, relationships and experiences in general… There is a very real essence that remains within those involved, even after the physical manifestations of these occurrences have passed. Traumatic experiences have a way of leaving a kind of “imprint” on our spiritual and psychological nature…**

**Although the physical situation is no longer present in our lives, we still embody the energies, complexes and internal conditions that were acquired through these traumatic experiences… which of course applies to past and present incarnations. This is one of those concepts that may seem “obvious” to some… but there is a big difference between hearing this concept once and truly coming to comprehend the “actuality” of it.**

**The internal conditions that we acquire through these traumatic experiences, whether it be depression, anxiety, self-doubt or fear of all kinds… No matter what it might be, it exists at the spiritual and psychological level as an entity which inhabits us… One which was brought into existence, by us, during this traumatic event or period… We create them unknowingly with intentions, emotions and “mind power” … and to a degree this is unavoidable, it is just how we function.**

**In order to “move forward” from these lingering conditions in a healthy and beneficial manner, we must address them on an internal basis (spiritual and psychological). For one to heal these “damaged” parts of themselves, they must make a dedicated effort towards understanding these conditions on a more intimate level… But the very first step in this process is acknowledging that these aspects of ourselves exist in the first place, from this point growth can truly begin.**

**Two of our greatest tools which will aid us in overcoming and transmuting these conditions, are self-observation and self-reflection… One should regularly observe their own behavior as if from an outside perspective, when alone and when interacting with others. Being self-observant of how we interact with those around us can shed much light on how these internal conditions are manifesting through us in our daily lives… All too often have I seen people treat others terribly due to their own inner darkness (Depression, self-hatred, self-doubt etc.) and not even notice it… Also have I seen people let others treat them terribly for the same reasons, not realizing that this kind of behavior is stemming from one of these internal conditions… but as we become more self-observant, we start to “catch ourselves in the act” so to speak.**

**It is also important to be aware of the thoughts coming into our heads at any given time, as well as to be aware of what is taking place within our physical surroundings… all the while keeping watch to see if any of these factors are acting as a trigger for these “negative” internal conditions. Often times, an individual might all the sudden find themselves “overcome” by this internal darkness and have not the slightest idea why… Self-observation helps us become more vigilant of when thoughts or external influences could be triggering these different internal conditions. Upon identifying a trigger, it is important not to simply eliminate it… but to first intimately ponder why this factor was a trigger in the first place, even beyond the obvious reasons. Simply removing or eliminating the factors which bring our inner darkness to the surface, only pushes us farther from understanding and healing it.**

**There are different levels of self-reflection as it pertains to overcoming these trauma based internal conditions… Firstly, a daily self-reflection upon the events of the day, internal and external… such as thoughts that crossed your mind, interactions you had with others, activities you participated in. When reflecting upon these things ask yourself if any of your behavior that day might have been reflective of these internal conditions. The next level of self-reflection would be to think back to the actual physical circumstances which resulted in these conditions, whether it be a traumatic relationship, situation, series of events or any other factor… Bring these memories to the surface, while in a reflective state of mind, so you may ponder how these conditions gradually developed throughout the course of whatever the traumatic circumstance was… Imagine who you were prior to these experiences, how have you changed? What about your behavior is different since these conditions became active? Retrace the steps which resulted in resulted this darkness, no matter how hard it might be…**

**Remember to always show compassion to this inner darkness, it is not an “enemy” by any means… it is a part of our very essence and by putting in the effort to heal these conditions, we liberate the attached entity… in turn liberating that part of ourselves. Transmutation at its finest…**

I took a lot of notes throughout, and noticed that after I read it, it was hard for me to consistently remember all the things that the book went over. 
So I created this free prompt and thought I'd share it! It is to be read aloud and listened to as you enjoy a meal. I've noticed that doing this with the first meal of the day for me has been really helpful in addition to using this app to log my meals. I've linked website that reads text aloud which is my preferred way to listen to the prompt. I hope this helps, let me know if you have any suggestions or notes! 

The book, which is a free audiobook on Spotify premium: 
""Mindful Eating: A Guide to Rediscovering a Healthy and Joyful Relationship with Food"" by Jan Chozen Bays and Jon Kabat-Zinn narrated by Jan Chozen Bays and Kaleo Griffith

The website, also free:  https://www.naturalreaders.com/online/

The prompt: 
Before you eat, read this or play it then log and put phone down:

• I'm about to eat. 
• Am I hungry? Which of my 9 hungers is it? Can I satisfy any of the hungers without food?
• Pause 
• Stop and look at the food. Does is look nice? Is it the right amount? What colors are in it? 
• Pause
• Smell it. Does it smell appetizing?
• Pause 
• Take a bite. How's it taste? What flavors can I find? Keep the bite in cheek to eat more slowly. Chew slowly and think about the flavor. 
• Pause 
• Put the fork down in-between bites and focus on the bite in your mouth only. Close your eyes and really taste it. 
• Pause
• Look at the food again and think about where each part came from and how many people worked to get it here for you. Thank them by eating this food with love and gratitude. 
• Continue to do this throughout the first half of the meal and try to notice if you start to rush. 
• Pause
• Stop half way through and drink some water. Does the water help clear your mouth and reset it? Are you still hungry?
• Pause
• Take another bite and notice how it tastes different or the same as your last bite. Did the water change anything? 
• Take a few more bites slowly and feel for stomach hunger. Are you satisfied with how much you've eaten so far? Would it feel better to stop or finish it? Are you finishing it to satisfy something other than body hunger? 
• Pause
• When you decide to end the meal, think about the last bite being the bookend. Make it last and really enjoy it.
• Pause
• If there is any left over, cover it, throw it out, or give it away.
• How do you feel? Are you satisfied? What did you enjoy most? 
• Log the rest and move on with the day knowing you had a great meal! ",False,I made a Mindful Eating Guided Prompt,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/1azao3w/i_made_a_mindful_eating_guided_prompt/

I have been studying a double Bachelor in History and Anthropology in Germany, Münster for a year now and I have come to the realization that it's not for me. My mental health has been steadily declying and I am deeply frustrated with my life, as I feel like I haven't gotten anywhere since graduation.

While the lessons were interesting and thought provoking, I never quite got the hang of writing long essays (especially in a language that isn't even my own) nor reading long, complicated texts. As much as I find the community welcoming and helpful, when i do my uni work I always feel like I am moving a mountain while for my fellow students it's like kicking a pebble (even with the stress that naturally comes with studying).  

Moreover, the prospect of our first fieldwork studies and internships are very daunting to me and I don't think I have the mindset to  complete them successfully.

Therefore, I have been brainstorming for  possible new paths for my life to take. So far I have been thinking of focusing on my strengths, in order to find something suitable!

I love English and I've even tried to complete a Bachelor back in own hometown (Genova,🇮🇹) but it didn't work out and I am afraid that starting it here in Germany again will yield just about the same outcomes. 

Other things that inspire me are animals, nature and plants so maybe something that has to do with animal care (dog grooming, zookeeper...ecc.). 

If i were to still consider an academical path something along the lines of pedagogy or social work although I wouldn't know where to start in how to educate myself about the topics. Other options would be anything that has to with English but not Anglistics! 

I know that this sound like quite a lot and I am aware that I won't be able to find the thing for me immediately, but if you happen to know any field/Ausbildungsstelle here in Germany, preferably NRW, that has to do with any of my strenghts it'd be immensely helpful!

For over 20 years I have been having a really difficult time releasing emotion from my body.  Anytime my body feels like it should relax and let loose a natural emotion such as sadness, laughter, excitement I get this choked up feeling that pushes it back down and I am left feeling unfulfilled, almost like the feeling you get when you start to yawn but get interrupted.  Another way to describe it is like a rubber band where the stronger the situation the more I can feel my body resisting to pull it back to status quo.

I don't know how to just let loose and let the emotions flow.  Best example I can give is playfulness, like say wrestling and laughing with a child, or throwing paint at each other while painting, or any of those cliches.  People can just be in those moments and have fun but my body instead shuts down instead.  I enjoy things, I find things funny, but laughing or smiling for more than a second or two and my body immediately starts pulling back and I lose it instead of releasing it.

Anyone else have this issue or know how to start working on overcoming it?

Perhaps our mobility, our health, our energy, our memory, our parents, our friends and spouses, our brothers and sisters, and maybe even some of our children who die before we do.

Many times, we may eventually even lose our surviving children's respect, as they shoulder the additional financial, physical and psychological burdens of taking care of us that, when piled on top of their other problems and responsibilities, becomes a burden.

And at some point, although we hold this off as long as possible, we might also lose our self-esteem; our reason for living. We may even lose our future as we find ourselves sitting in our rocking chairs cherishing the good old days which are all that we have left now.

It's at this point, if we are at all sensitive and intelligent, that we might wonder if this is all there is to life, a life that has gone by so swiftly that it is now merely a blur.

But it's way too late to do any investigating now into the meaning of life. We just don't have the energy. Our fate has been cast. The good and bad kamma that we have made for ourselves in a lifetime of activity will shortly dictate our destination, as we are hurtled into our next existence.

What was our lifestyle? Our habits? All we have to do is look back at what we did every day to see where we are going. What was our level of consciousness? What were our strategies in life? What were our ambitions? This is the level at which we will seek our new existence and these will be our strategies the next time around.

The problem is; if our strategies were merely aimed at seeking endless pleasure, comfort and satisfaction for ourselves and those around us, we might have burned up all our good kamma from previous existences. Then, like the mighty gods who have it so comfy that they believe that their constant pleasures will last forever, we will fall from our deluded sense of security no differently than the Gods will fall from their temporary heavens when their good kamma is all burned up.

Because these existences are all impermanent, the Buddha explained how to transcend existence all together, whether that existence is in the human realm or the god realms. Eventually, if we just enjoy our good kamma , our good luck so to speak, that kamma will eventually exhaust itself. Unless we use whatever good kamma we have accumulated to free ourselves from existence, rather than simply enjoying it, our future existences will be uncertain and possibly much more stressful and troublesome than our present existence.

The Buddha said that the tears we have shed in our past existences would fill the oceans. And the tears we will cry in the future may even be greater. Therefore, isn't it time to get out of this endless cycle of old age and death?

Old age and death is dependent on birth. Unless we are born, there will be no old age and death. So what causes birth? That is, what causes our consciousness, when released at death, to seek another form in which to continue existence?

The psychic and spiritual impetus for this transference of consciousness from one lifetime to another, one form to another, is our desire to exist. We cling to our bodies and minds, we are attached to our bodies and minds, and as such, a powerful desire persists at death to somehow continue. This is called the thirst for existence in the form realm.

So, how does this great craving for continuance of our ""selves"" come about?

It begins with our distorted view of life. We see life as desirable, fun, and... actually we love life! In contrast, the Buddha said that life is ""Dukkha,"" suffering.

We also see life as something permanent, that we and the things and people around us will never change. We buy a new car and never think that it will soon become worn out, unfashionable, and obsolete. We choose a partner in life and never consider that he or she will soon become old and diseased. We live life in the fast lane and never see the long-term consequences until it is usually too late. The Buddha said ""Anicca,"" that all things in material existence change.

And the most insidious thing we misunderstand, the very quintessence of that which catapults us into one lifetime after another of endless births and deaths, is the mistaken, deluded idea that there is someone behind it all, a little man or woman, a little self that is in control of everything. The Buddha said, ""Anatta."" There is no self, there is no soul.

The realization that there is no self, that there is no continuing soul, that everything changes and we can't control anything for long, and further, that life is constant stress and discontent that must be dealt with endlessly - these simple truths, when understood in the heart, are the very things that free us from future existences. Understanding these things require more than intellectual consideration, however; it requires a shift in consciousness. And every time we shift our consciousness, we alter our destiny in the next lifetime.

When our consciousness shifts, we find ourselves gravitating toward a different lifestyle from our previous one. Usually, the new lifestyle is much simpler, less complicated, and the strategies change as well.

Strategies of securing pleasure and comfort change into strategies of discovering that which does not change, that which does not lead to discontent and stress, and that which understands at a very deep level the idea of self, the idea of ego, and subsequently seeks to dissolve that delusion which keeps the mind imprisoned and circulating from one existence to another.

In other words, we take on a new strategy that will be there for us when the end comes, and which we always face alone. If you are involved in a horrific car accident tomorrow where your body is pinned and the blood is flowing so fast that you know you have only a few minutes to live... what will be your refuge? Your parents? Your spouse? Your children? Your house? Your career? Your knowledge and titles? Your religion?

This new strategy to face death with courage and calmness will involve what is commonly called spiritual training. It is a voluntary responsibility that can only be pursued with a mind that is strategizing toward liberation. A mind that has not yet shifted consciousness and is still caught in the idea that worldly things and people will somehow create happiness if all our strategies and combinations work out falls short of the necessary courage and conviction required to deepen the training to an extent that all strategizing ceases. When all strategizing ceases, this is release.",False,The Essence of Buddhism,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/1awda9z/the_essence_of_buddhism/

It was my RESISTANCE towards my shadow that created these problems. It was my unwillingness to look the darkness in the eyes that perpetuated these cycles I found myself stuck in.  
The more I learned to look my shadow straight into the eyes - the more I saw the beauty in it.  
What I had perceived to be my enemy, was my greatest friend. However, since I was so busy running away from it - believing it to be the cause of my suffering - I never stopped to pay attention to it.  
What I discovered was that actually my shadow was my wounded inner child. That I had ignored for many years.  
It wasn’t there to hurt me. It just wanted to get my attention.  
Can you imagine looking into yourself, expecting to see a dark monster and when you actually look deeply you look into the eyes of an innocent child that is just hurting?  
That is exactly what it was like for me. Seeing that my shadow is just my wounded inner child filled my heart with deep self compassion and self love.

As this has happened to me in the past.  
The truth is that I am holding back my joy, peace and love a lot in order to not offend people or make them feel too uncomfortable.  
This is one of the side affects of becoming completely in touch with your inner child again.  
You will start laughing for no reason, you will love the people around you so much that it makes them comfortable, you will be so at peace that it actually disturbs other people, as it highlights their lack of peace with themselves.

Besides those occasions, I've never truly experienced loneliness, hurt, sadness, or even compassion to a degree. Mostly, I've been consumed by frustration, anger, resentment, and, above all, fear.

Since practicing mindfulness, I've noticed how these hidden emotions would surface, and i also noticed my usual initial reaction to this super subtle event, which was to automatically dismiss it. I can imagine that these subtle sparks of emotion have been enough throughout my life to fuel many of my negative and depressing thoughts, not to mention the numbed, dissociated state in which I've spent most of my life. Aside from anxiety and a sense of impending doom i sometimes feel very lonely and hurt, at times sad.. sometimes it's really hard to tell what it feels like, but it's something like that.

My question now is how to approach these emotions. First i learned how to ""catch and keep"" them, next i would try to just sit with them and observe. But i found this way the emotions were at it's weakest and be gone after a very short while. I thought this approach would be in line with what I've learned from mindfulness practices, but the only way I can truly feel these emotions is by fully immersing myself in them and experiencing them firsthand. Sometimes, this process can be quite consuming, and I feel as though I'm stuck in a particular situation, although I can't pinpoint exactly what it is.

So, is there anything you can recommend to me? I am aware of the potential for retraumatization, but to be honest, I'm not concerned with that. What worries me more is the possibility of not being able to process these feelings in a constructive manner.

**An Unidentified Yearning-**

**In a world full of people who are severely deprived of their Spiritual roots**, we all crave a Higher/Mystical Connection and Experience to some degree, whether we realize it or not… **perhaps even especially** those who one might consider a “**Non-Believer**” in such topics of discussion…

Yet, near always these Individuals are simply unaware that this **Higher Connection is the missing link**… they just perceive it as a deeply rooted, most always unacknowledged, “Unidentified Yearning” … **oblivious to the cause**, therefor unable to address it… though it is still **felt true** none the less.

This is why, and I quote, “Fantasy”/ “Fiction” based movies, shows, video games and trains of thought, are **a significant source of Comfort and Balance for many modern Individuals**... they are their means of **briefly escaping** the dull, **spiritually suppressed “reality”** that they live in… This is often the closest that they can get to a Direct Experience which satisfies and titillates their Inner **Divine Spark** and temporarily sooths that **“Unidentified Yearning”.**

Though, **this media-based input**, which is more than often the only place where they see these “Higher Concepts” present, **Intentionally misconveys them** for their own agenda… “Hollywoodizing” and Fictionalizing the pieces of truth within their material, labeling such phenomena as “unrealistic” and out of legitimate reach… meanwhile hoarding and utilizing it for themselves…

When I was trying to focus on the study material, I could only focus on words, but couldn't comprehend anything. My mind would ask ""What am I supposed to comprehend? How am I supposed to comprehend? Is comprehension supposed to be imagining every word?"" and so on. Hitherto, comprehension for me was automatic. Yes, my focus would often shift elsewhere, but when I was reading something, I could comprehend easily. It was a subconscious thing, an automatic thing. So was memorizing things or retrieving something from memory.

My typing speed lessened (imagine if I was employed what would have happened) as I was doing things more consciously, since typing is mostly subconscious.

Half an hour might not sound like a lot, but once you factor in setting up and 'coming back' it's often 40 minutes in reality. That's already a significant chunk of the day's non-working hours, and psychologically it translates into 'nearly an hour'.

A few people meditate for 40 minutes a day for years on end, but I've realised that's unusual. It doesn’t prove it's possible for most of us.

In real life, for a lot of people -- probably most -- it just isn't sustainable. We can do it for a while, perhaps by sacrificing other activities that are valuable, meaningful or beneficial (such as exercise and sleep). But it requires constant effort to keep other things at bay. Sooner or later we'll lapse, and when we do it's hard to start again -- because there's a pernicious message hidden in well-meant advice: 'You should do it for half an hour every day to really benefit' sends the unintentional message that 'If you're not doing 30 mins a day, you might as well not bother at all.'

So we have this unrealistic ideal presented as a normal lifestyle for somebody who meditates, and then we feel like there's something wrong with us when we fall short. But the reason we're not doing 30 minutes every day isn't because there's something wrong with us; it's because there's something wrong with the advice. It's advice that's not suited to real life for most people.

As little as 12 minutes daily meditation has been shown to have measurable benefits. And it's better to do 12 mins every day indefinitely than to do 40 minutes for a few weeks and then not at all for however it takes until we gather the resolve to make the next 'big push'.

We can then top this up with longer sits whenever we have the opportunity -- on weekends, say, or perhaps with an evening group, or even on a retreat (though it's unhelpful to normalise retreats, because they're exceptional too).

There's often judgement hidden in well-rehearsed advice from meditation teachers. Comments like 'our lives are so filled with business and distractions' can send a message that 'Your life is full of unnecessary activities and meaningless distractions. You need to get your priorities right. Like I have. *I* meditate for half an hour every day.'

But the daily practice of the meditation teachers who give this advice is completely different from that of an ordinary person. For a meditation teacher, mediation is a way of life; that's why they become meditation teachers. They are already among the outliers for whom practicing for a substantial chunk of time every day is realistic. They're a self-selecting population who are completely unrepresentative, and it's easy for them to forget this. On top of that, once they become teachers, they have a very powerful motive for their daily practice that most of never will: it's their professional responsibility. Just like it's the professional responsibility of a firefighter to keep fit and the professional responsibility of a political analyst to read the news every day. Or perhaps they aren't professionals, but teaching meditation is something that gives them social status or gives their lives meaning, and that gives them a similar sense of involvement and responsibility.

For the rest of us, it's perfectly legitimate to be busy! It's not necessarily our fault that we're busy doing things that aren't meditating and it's not necessarily a bad thing. We *should* get enough sleep. We *should* exercise. We *should* play. We *should* spend time with the people we love. We *should* take time to just relax and do nothing (and meditating, regardless of philosophical claims to the contrary, *is* 'doing something', because it uses up willpower and fills a slot in our schedule). Most people already don't have enough time to do all these healthy things as much as they're told they ought to. And every minute we meditate is a minute spent not doing something else -- something that might be even more valuable and beneficial to ourselves or somebody else. We should recognise that this trade-off might be legitimate, and 'own' it, not feel guilty, and not feel like we aren't real meditators because we do 12 minutes a day rather than 30, or 60, or whatever other number a well-intentioned teacher comes up with on the unscientific and unrepresentative basis of their own experience.

It went on for a while in the beginning i found it quite useful. The guy described an approach of basically an endless spiral of relaxation from moment to moment, while letting go (dropping the ball) and just perceive the present moment. At least that's my takeaway from all the things he said in the beginning.  


This has been quite the timing as i just started practicing and experimenting with mindfulness plus i'm dealing with lots of stress, anxiety and dissociation at the moment.

SO FAR i can say that this philosophy of dropping the ball (basically letting go of everything) alone has made a huge difference to my inner peace. I used to feel alienated by the present moment alot, i just made a post about it yesterday. This morning i felt just horrible. After practicing what i've heard i feel much better.  


There's just one thing that i feel i'm quite conflicted about it; he then proceeded to go really deep into the concept of ego death and what the experience entails, and i almost got few panic attacks by just listening. I can't really summarize everything, but most of you are probably already really familiar with it.   


It was basically stuff how he really broke down the perception of reality in a super abstract way because this would be the ultimate way to let go of any obejctity and subjectivity or something like that. I'm sorry but it's hard for me to summarize it all that well. It sounded to me like he basically described my experiences with derealization and depersonalization episodes, which were horrible.  


Now i'm worried a bit about how much i should dive into this practice and the philosophy behind it. On the one hand i feel a bit better after watching the video, on the other hand i feel a bit more anxious.  


To just ask very naively; am i supposed to feel derealization and depersonalization in a state of ego death or during the process?  


I loved the idea of just being able to let go of everything and find peace in the process, but it sounded like this was the beginning of some weird trip.

Now, after years of being numbed to certain feelings, I'm slowly starting to feel again, and it's quite challenging at times.

I began practicing mindfulness not too long ago, and initially, it almost made everything more challenging. I suppose this is partly because being present unsettles me. I'm not sure what the exact conflict is, but it leads me to question my existence (spiritually, I guess) and my reality. This is probably also because I'm still mostly dissociated, and confronting that too much is scary.

On the flip side, mindfulness has also provided me with something to counteract all this. Being present, at times, gives me a glimpse of calmness, peace, and safety.

I've likely been running from something my whole life because I've lived without breaks. I didn't treat myself like a human being, more like a machine that's either working or consuming entertainment all the time. I'm not even sure if that would be an issue at all if there wasn't something inside of me that's crying for attention.

To slow my days down, I regularly take breaks between activities where I try to let everything go and just be. I notice that whenever I skip these breaks, I get pretty anxious. But to be fair, I can't take that many breaks all day for the rest of my life, lol. I suppose I'll keep most of the good stuff and somehow get better, so slowing down in the evening is sufficient for calming my nerves.  


I can just hope that i'm on a good way to heal. After all the crashes and burnouts i had in my life, this one feels different. The mindfulness element makes life feel unfamiliar, but whenever i think about how it felt before i get the sense that this is acutally a good thing.

When someone recommends media to me that is longer than 30 minutes long, I dig in my heels. Irrationally, regardless of quality or how compatible it could be with my interests, sometimes someone just gets too persistent about wanting me to watch their favorite piece of media. Audio books that are 16 hours long, podcasts with hundreds of episodes, games that require money to buy. Occasionally, even heavily recommending something *once* will make me defensive and upset- probably because I don't know how to deal with the slight pressure that is being placed on me. If these heavy recommendations go on, I usually get even more defensive. 

It's not that I dislike long media- I watch the 6 hour version of pride and prejudice at least once a year. But the combination of people pushing to use my time and the stress of not having time for myself gets to me more than I'd like to admit.

I find myself often getting affected, becoming mad and angry by how others do things or just their energy. I need some advice on how do i protect my own energy without getting affected much by others and increase my own sense of well being. How do i protect my positivity, self-esteem and mindset? I used to do this a lot but certain traumas before some years made me very sensitive to everyones energy, how do i go back to that state? Maybe some helpful yt channels? How do i lower the fear of what others think of me or how would they perceive me? Also i tend to blame myself too much of things that im not responsible for? Sometimes i feel bad about others and then somehow that makes me feel bad too. How do i disconnect from this state completely because sometimes i feel that it is impossible for me to overcome all of this trauma? 
Dealing with this trauma has also made me unable to love and enjoy many things that i used to, idk how to deal when i think of all of these issues together sadly :/

Take a moment to wish for your own happiness and peace. Then, think about someone you care about and wish them well too. Don't stop there, include someone you don't know well, and even someone you have a hard time with. Imagine sending good vibes to them too.

The idea is to feel connected and spread a bit of kindness around. It's simple, but I think it can make a difference in how we feel and how we treat each other.

This particular section speaks about routine and your body becoming stuck on autopilot from frequently repeating the same daily tasks over again. Like in the way you get ready, drive to work the same route, seeing the same collaeagues and facing the same challenges at work, etc. 

This in turn, causes the body to act on autopilot rendering your mind unconscious and thus bringing you out of the present moment. As you are repeating the same actions as the previous days your future has no opportunity to change. You become bored/complacent, are not growing as a person and leave no room for the ‘unknown’ which is the most exciting part of living.

My main state throughout almost all of my life has been mostly dissociated, ranging from feeling numb to myself to experiencing actual derealization/depersonalization (DR/DP).

So far, practicing mindfulness feels safe for me. That's probably also because I'm trying to regain access to my inner self, to everything I buried down there. I guess suppressed feelings are way scarier after a while than invited feelings. I mention this because I could imagine mindfulness practice isn't exactly helpful for someone with acute DR/DP.

I'm not only practicing this for a set time in the morning and evening but also throughout most of my day. In the beginning, it felt super weird, but just recently it began to feel quite good.

There are situations where I feel chaotic background noise going on inside me, which certainly distracts from the attention I'm trying to direct to the present moment. But it's fine; my philosophy for now is to just accept everything that is and let go.

There is something that's weirding me out though. Occasionally, I feel like I can't trust myself to just be, and there's an urge to control every next step I'm going to take. It feels like a cheap substitute for feeling myself. Because most of the time, I'm not really feeling myself yet. I've had recent ""moments,"" though, which I consider groundbreaking.

Just this morning, I was on the phone with my mom, and after a few minutes of talking, I realized I'm not prethinking or controlling the things I'm saying to her.

I know this sounds weird, but I guess this is the kind of stuff you experience when your life has gone a certain way.

I could also imagine that this would be somewhat normal for some people; they aren't questioning the way they process life that much.

This could potentially scare me, but I'm going to treat it like all the other stuff I'm dealing with right now—I'm just accepting it and letting it go.

Sometimes we feel some presence but may not understand that it’s related to shamanism. However, the call doesn’t come to you just like that, it’s an important message for you from the spirit world, a kind of assistance in fulfilling your destiny.  
If shamanism hasn’t been passed down to you through ancestors, is it possible to become a shaman? Yes, because shamanism is a calling chosen by spirits, and anyone - even you - can become one.

Sign 1. You often find it difficult to fit into a group because people do not understand you and you cannot share your feelings and visions with them.  
Shamans in most cultures were loners (often living on the outskirts of the village), and they were often seen as eccentric or ""different"". However, they were respected for the wisdom they shared. Because of their unique gifts and sensitivity, shamans could never fit into typical society, as they acted as a bridge between this and the invisible worlds.

Sign 2. Vivid flying dreams, prophetic dreams.  
Some shamans are born with a natural ability to journey between worlds, gather information, and even see visions of future events through their dreams.  
Have you noticed that your dreams come true?

Sign 3. Frequent deja vu sensations.  
This feeling that you should be here and have already been here, as if aligning with a predetermined path. It’s not surprising, as shamans are very sensitive, and their ability to journey between worlds creates opportunities to see what will happen.

Sign 4. Strong connection with nature: plants or animals.  
You may feel that being in nature is the only time when you can truly be yourself.  
You draw energy from every living creature around you. You feel at home in nature... the connection you share is not just superficial, it is very deep.

Sign 5. You are drawn to herbs or natural healing products and instinctively know what you need to use.  
Using the wisdom of the spirits, shamans can blend natural herbal remedies to heal both the energetic and physical body. Interestingly, many herbs used in traditional shamanism for healing are now scientifically validated. If you find yourself naturally drawn to the kitchen and garden with herbs to heal any ailments, it may be a sign of a past connection to the world of shamanism.

Sign 6. You feel awakened, joyful, or calm from the sound of a drum.  
Shamans use drums to assist them in journeying to other worlds or to guide other spirits.  
If you have a strong passion for the sound of drums and other percussion instruments, it may be a sign that you have roots in shamanism.

Sign 7. Near-death or out-of-body experience.  
To become a shaman, one must undergo a ""death and rebirth,"" often manifesting as a temporary illness or a shocking crisis. It is through overcoming and healing from this experience that the future shamans renounce everything they know as truth, in pursuit of the wisdom they are destined to attain.

Sign 8. Profession related to healing arts.  
You may already be working with the healing of other people or animals, whether it is in medicine, psychology, or even volunteering. The important thing is that you have found your calling in a profession that helps others.

While you might ask, what is mindfulness and how do I attain it, isn't it equally important (if not moreso) to ask what is the nature of the loss that perpetuates the cycle? Why do we spend so much time and effort on attaining it with better frequency and yet spend relatively little time and thought on maintaining it for longer periods of time. 

Now, I understand that some will say ""just keep doing the practices that led you to attain it, and you won't lose it"", but this often just doesn't apply to a large number of people. Sometimes, one makes a major effort to attain mindfulness through some sort of intervention into one's life. This happens because one hits a low enough point, and one is willing to invest serious energy into fixing things. Then, one gets their life together and tries to return to normalcy, but with newfound knowledge.

I think there are a couple possible answers to this.

1. The moderate approach: watch your energy expenditure. Don't exhaust yourself so you don't have the energy to be mindful when you need it. Plan ahead and make sure you won't regret what you're doing right now.

2. The extreme approach: there are two paths, on the path and off it. Whenever you try to take ""newfound knowledge"" back from mindfulness practices, you inevitably lose it because the _practice_ was essential to continue in the first place. It's like brushing your teeth — no one would think it's weird to complain about dirty teeth simply because you learned how to brush them last week and did a really good job of cleaning them then.

I think I allow my discipline to slide by bargaining that I'm doing it for fun and to be a balanced human, and this goes on until the base (basically physical health) of my mindfulness is gone. Granted, I _should_ be resilient and bounce back from bad weekends or weeks or months, but I find that it's easy to get stuck in ruts whether they are positive or negative ones. This issue compounds significantly with stressful situations. You have more things to do, less time to do them, and you can end up being even _less_ efficient with your time because you feel the stress.

I think it's some kind of unconscious desire to break conventions or something? I'm a pretty reserved quiet type, good kid irl and always have been.

opening a package of granola bars or something I pierce it in the middle of the front with my thumb and just rip it up to make it look like a rodent got it or something.

What kind of message am I trying to send?

Typing items into my (shared with kids) google keep grocery list. I don't misspell them on purpose but if I make a typo I will sometimes make a little effort, extra click to *keep the typo* instead of autocorrecting. Or related but not typo, If I want protein bars and start typing the word ""protein"", protein bars or protein powder are options. I click away from the suggestions and leave just ""protein"" on my list, actually putting ""protein bars"" maybe is too proper and stuck up or something? The fonz or some ""cool guy"" my lol parents liked would probably never type out stuff fully. Again not sure if I would do this if it was not shared, no one else could see.


When I was a kid, formalities, greetings and stuff saying ""hi"" and ""bye"" like that to adults always seemed highly embarrassing, sorta a prostrating type feel in sorta in the same type way.

If I'm driving I'll make an effort to actually process if I really ""need"" to use a turn signal, are people far enough away to not matter? When I could just click the signal on easier than all that.

Now thinking is become a skill that is atrophying. Therefore I will be worse at conversing, recalling from memory, etc. So I've started to try and think again, asking myself questions, but I feel like this is creating a new bad habit. Or maybe it's good I don't know. I was just starting to notice how unhappy I was constantly being the observer and never getting swept away with emotion or thoughts. The whole day, unless I was talking to someone, my thoughts were just one liners because I was letting them go. I noticed life was starting to get boring because I would spend so much of my free time meditating. 

I'm a big walker/runner so I got into the habit of meditating while doing those activities, which resulted in racking up hours a day of meditation for years. So this narrative of, I really switched the way my brain works and I'll never go back to just thinking, I'm going to continue losing my identity because whatever I learned through mindfulness lessons over the years (i used to do headspace multiple times a day, so I've noticed a lot of subconscious thoughts echoing what I used to hear). It's kind of scary, almost like brainwashing to a certain extent (the way I went about it).

Anyways, I went through a phase where I thought the goal was that if you were in the present moment, you had no thoughts because you were just engaged with your physical surroundings. So I think I went about it the wrong way without looking for guidance since I thought Andy from headspace was enough haha. I noticed this became a problem when I realized how often I was ""noting"" thoughts. It became a habit when I would be out walking and it got to a point where I literally wasn't trying to note, but I was aware of my subconscious mind doing it all on it's own. That's when I kind of took  a step back and started to see my relationship with meditation and mindfulness  in a not so favorable view. Being confused when socializing because you don't know what you're going to say next because you noticed how thoughts just come and go out of no where? Like come on that's no fun is it?

We were living at Wat Pah Nanachat, one of Ajahn Chah’s branch monasteries set up for foreigners, and one day after Janet and I had ordained as a nin and maechi, Ajahn Sumedho invited us to accompany him to Ajahn Chah’s main monastery. 

When we arrived, Ajahn Sumedho motioned to me to follow him into the forest. After walking some way, he stopped at a large tree and paced off about ten steps as if looking for treasure. He then pointed to the ground and said, “It would be good if someone would dig here.” I found a stout branch and began digging until I hit something hard.

The mason jar was filled with a thick green liquid in which round blackish blobs were floating. Ajahn Sumedho opened the jar, retrieved a blob and ate it. “Not quite ready, he said, here, try one!” I obediently fished out a blob and ate it. Not bad, kind of salty with the texture of a prune. After reburying the jar, and on our way back to the sala, Ajahn Sumedho explained that the fruit was in the process of being aged pickled. I then made the mistake of asking in what the fruit was being pickled, to which Ajahn Sumedho replied, “my urine.”

When we reached the sala, Ajahn Chah was sitting in the front with a group of his monks. Ajahn Sumedho walked up to him, pointed at Janet and I in the back, and said a few words, which I assumed was introducing us as the ""Rocks (our last name) from Boulder (CO) "" the nickname with which Ajahn Sumedho tagged us. After Ajahn Chah said a few words in reply, Ajahn Sumedho rejoined us in the back of the sala. When I asked him what Ajahn Chah said, he replied, ""You will never find a diamond in a Rock,"" with no further explanation.

As I dive deeper into mindfulness and meditation and study different philosophies, 3 questions come up for me that I have yet to be able to answer. 

What’s your take? 

1. Sometimes the analogy of being present in our day to day is compared with the sensation of, “waking up.” Which it really does feel that way. You’re lost in thought and then boom, all of the sudden you’re aware. It’s been coached of me to find that and to practice that continues work of, “waking up.” Is this a practice you would encourage through your day to day? 

2. My understanding is that our ideal state would be constant presence. When I am present, I notice something about that moment. Sensation/thought/or emotion. Is it correct that if we were in a perfect world, that’s how we would live, completely present (outside of the chosen moments of using our brain?) 

3. When my focus is on the present, I no longer live in my imagination. Sometimes that sucks. Sometimes me fantasizing about me seeing my long distance girlfriend is much more enjoyable for me than focusing on the way my foot feels stepping on the floor. I even read in, “the body keeps the score,” that our imagination and fantasizing is a healthy way to escape our world….which one is it. Am I ok fantasizing and being lost in thought, or should I practice being present? 

4. I’m yet to be convinced that living present brings me more joy that being lost in thought. 50% of the time being lost in thought is actually enjoyable for me. Helps time pass when doing boring tasks. I find mindfulness most helpful when in difficult situations or challenging moments emotionally. Keeps perspective. Is it really our goal to not be lost in thought?

Many may unknowingly experience withdrawal symptoms when detaching from these aspects of their lives. It's crucial to recognize these diverse withdrawal factors, understand the coping mechanisms available, and provide support for those navigating these challenges—breaking the stigma that withdrawal is solely tied to substances.

One such friendship is with Vera, whom I met during my time in Vancouver. Despite our age difference – Vera is over 60 – our shared interests made it effortless to engage in deep, meaningful conversations.

What stood out about Vera was her ability to navigate life's challenges with unwavering peace and grace. Intrigued, I once asked her the secret behind her tranquility, and her response, though simple, left a profound impact on me: ""Through a lot of hardships.""

In conversations about inner peace, practices like mindfulness and meditation often take the spotlight, but true inner peace, I've come to realize, is rooted in inner strength, forged through overcoming hardships. A quote from ""The Power of Now"" encapsulates this sentiment: ""The down cycle is absolutely essential for spiritual realization. You must have failed deeply or experienced some profound loss or pain to be drawn to the spiritual dimension."" This rings true for inner peace as well — building inner strength precedes finding inner peace.

Inner strength serves as a grounding force, providing stability when external circumstances threaten to upend us. It is the unwavering belief in oneself when the world offers little support.

Throughout my journey, I've distilled three potent practices that have played a pivotal role in cultivating inner strength:

**1. Embrace the Moments of Silence and Stillness**

Inner strength finds its roots in our sense of inner belonging—a deep connection, acceptance, and alignment with ourselves. To nurture this unshakeable foundation, take moments to embrace silence and stillness. By slowing down, pausing, and appreciating the quietude around you, you can reconnect with your inner self. As external distractions fade away, the voice from your heart becomes clearer, guiding you towards inner peace.

**2. Practice Deep Listening**

The embodiment of inner strength is often reflected in our relationships through the practice of deep listening. This involves letting go of judgments and assumptions, focusing entirely on the other person. Deep listening is an act of love and confidence, requiring the release of control and the need for validation. It is a skill honed by those with true inner strength.

**3. Find Your Purpose**

A sense of purpose serves as an anchor in the ebb and flow of life. Regardless of external circumstances, knowing your purpose allows you to stay focused on what truly matters. Discovering your purpose requires introspection: What brings profound meaning to your life? What fulfills you? What are you willing to pursue, even without external validation or materialistic rewards? How can you leverage your gifts to add value to others' lives?

In the pursuit of lasting inner peace, let these practices be your compass, guiding you towards a profound connection with yourself and a resilient inner strength that withstands the tests of time.

I just read ""The Untethered Soul"" by Michael Singer. I thought it was an eye opening book and I've learned to observe my thoughts and emotions. This has enable me to deal with situations more calmy and feel more at peace.

However, it seems like the objective of this exercise in consciousness is to further and further disconnect with the energies in front of you (thoughts, emotions, sensory info...) and allow yourself to be ""swept up"" by the spirit that arises behind you.

He says something like, ""you'll realize there's a trade off between your personal energies and the amount of spirit you feel""  ""You must surrender your personal energies in order to be fully swept up by the spirit, be willing to die in order to be reborn"". I'm paraphrasing.

As someone who is a husband and father of a young kid, I feel like my family REQUIRES my personal energies. ""Sitting back"" and just watching things go on in front of me seems like such a passive way to live. Yes, if you want to be a monk and live on top of a mountain it would be easy, but as someone who is raising a family and working a job, I can't just be like, ""Oh wow, if I just sit back and observe my thoughts and feelings, rather than engage with them, my personal life will just carry on without me! I'm just enjoying my spirit ride over here!""

For example, let's say you have a deadline at work. You feel anxious because it's approaching...that particular anxiety is useful. It's a reminder that you need to get in gear. If you just sit back think, ""oh wow, look at all these anxious thoughts, I'll just let them pass through..."" You would never get anything done and would be fired. Your personal life will not just ""carry on""...you have a role in the world that other are counting on you for...

Anyway, I kind of feel like I rambled and didn't articulate myself. But that's my problem with some of these texts on consciousness....at some point you have to ""come off the mountain"".

Here is what happened : Tuesday night and I'm a 32-year-old bored teacher on vacation.

 What to do about it? Well I decided to ride my bike since it's been sometime I had done it for the last time. 

While riding it, I was listening to some Amazon original chilling out music . They're actually pretty good for walks and bike rides. 

It was getting late and I returned home. I wasn't tired; I just decided to return home. The very instant I opened the gate of my house ( I live in Brazil. Yeah, we have gates in our houses ), my sight started getting black and I knew I was about to pass out. The thing is, my friend has just lost a brother from a heart attack and he was two years younger than me, which made me think I was about to die too hahahah. 

So I had to sit down and it was what I did : put the bike aside and sat down. I was desperate : my sight was completely black and my heart was beating só fast for at least two minutes. Within these two minutes the music ""Andromeda - subtle lake"" was playing and I became fully aware of it. I thought "" breath, just breath because it's what you can do "". It didn't help much, but it was what I could do. The only thing I got was breathing, sitting and waiting for my sight to come back. 

Then it slowly started to come back and I noticed what I hadn't noticed before : the white light of the garage, the square tiles on the floor, felt the wood of the bench I was sitted, the smell of the sweat, was totally concentrated on the music I was listening too, notice the shadows of the objects on the garage, the temperature of the metallic key that opened the gate of my house... Anyway, things I don't cherish on a daily basis became suddenly so worthy. Only now I understand what the Mindfulness books say about meditating feeling the material of the bench you're sitted and the floor you're stepping on: these are daily things we always take for granted unless we lose them. We rarely or never cherish the capability of feeling stuff on our skin, the smells, the music we listen to on our cellphones... We always judge these experiences!

They were emaciated, unhealthy, eyes glazed, and agonal breathing all on their death bed surrounded by family. This image of someone on their deathbed puts all things into perspective in a way that I'm still having trouble articulating. My father was a chronic alcoholic who had his problems - but he was never mean or evil - and seeing him in that condition, in his last moments allowed me to release any of the final reservations I had about forgiveness and grace.

I have friends and family who I want in my life, who I want to connect more than they want to connect with me. Rumination and anger leading to me wanting to see them in a poor light and ghost them or isolate myself from them. To remove the trigger of my anxiousness and to perhaps hurt them by removing myself from their life, so they can ""feel"" how I feel and maybe understand it.

But late one night after waking up, I envisioned 2 of my friends, one platonic and one romantic interest, on their deathbeds. As horrible as described above. This strong imagery made me almost immediately let go of EVERYTHING. All resentment, anger, frustration, anxiousness, and frustration. 

Now, what If I could find a powerful thought like this for ANY problem I perceive in my life? A lot of people I believe do this frequently.

It seems there is an underlying trauma as well.

During these episodes, I have adopted new habits and mannerisms, essentially squinting my mind throughout the day. What I mean by that is, I have found a way to visually desensitize myself from my surroundings. It's like blunting my senses. At times, I automatically squint my eyes, for example, when I go to my bathroom and the light there is too bright, and I feel overwhelmed by the input.

I understand that it has helped somewhat in calming me down during my derealisation phases, but I have noticed that I do it almost all the time.

Recently, I listened to a podcast where a scientist spoke about the benefits of being mindful all the time.

Now, I am wondering where it would lead me if I proactively tried to change this habit. I tried it today during my time in the bathroom, getting ready for the day, showering, and cleaning the room, etc.

It felt really weird, and at times it frightened me. But I don't think it's a good thing to keep avoiding my daily reality all the time, right? I'm also wondering this has to do why i can not connect to my surroundings very well, building a sense of safety from my own home.

I also have immense issues with my nervous system getting overstimulated and agitated quite quickly, mostly from digital stuff, working, or playing in front of screens. Screens are the only thing I completely take in, and that's probably why they are the single most thing triggering my panic attacks and overwhelm. I feel like this is a huge hint to something.

On one side i feel like if i would change something towards being more present/mindful it could benefit me not being so consumed by my thoughts all the time, on the other hand i'm a bit afraid that i will drain my nervous system even more.

Lifes like a rollercoaster right?  Sometimes youre super happy and the next moment youre feeling down. Well guess what? Thats perfectly okay! 

Imagine a time when you didnt get the test grade you wanted. Its tough but those feelings are part of life. Instead of pushing them away try something called Radical Acceptance.

Its like saying ""Hey its okay to feel this way. Im here for you."" Youre not hiding your emotions - youre giving them a nod. And guess what? They start to loosen their grip on you. Youre not your emotions. Youre their superhero observer.

This Radical Acceptance thing can bring you inner peace like finding calm in a storm. From there you can handle lifes ups and downs better. So next time youre on that emotional rollercoaster remember to ride it with an open heart. You might discover self-compassion that changes your life.

I was in my car during my lunchtime minding my own business when the lady parked in the car next to mine loudly knocks at my window saying I had parked too close to her. I look down and not only there is plenty of space, but she was much closer to the line than I was. So I calmly point out that I am in my space and her car is much closer to the line than mine, again very calmly but my heart was racing. She insists and then says something rude like “close your door now before I hit it”
So I did. Went back to minding my own business but this interaction (even though it wasn’t even that terrible) not only hurt me but is now occupying a lot of space in my brain. This always happens when someone is rude to me and I have to somehow defend myself. 

Thing is, I never want to bother anyone but I am aware that sometimes I let people treat me a certain way or say certain things to me just because I hate confrontation so much. Then end up really regretting not saying anything later. But I never seem to be able to think calmly in those situations, my heart just races and I want it to stop. 
Then it occupies my brain for a long time and I struggle letting it go.

It's better when i'm not tired, have a bit of energy, which is kinda rare at the moment. I have this going on for over a year now, it's better at times, at times worse. At times i'm really stuck and i feel drained by the smallest things.  


These things can be digital work on my computer. But the most draining are the games i loved and used to play, mostly competitive shooters. I had to completely give up overwatch, after just one match in the evening i'm so close to a panic attack that i often wake up panicking in the middle of the night. I love other games as well, similar to overwatch, which i can tolerate better, but after a short while even these games are getting too much for me.  


Strangely enough i get anxiety and panick in my sleep from doing breathwork and meditation stuff too close to bed.   


AT THE VERY LEAST i could finally fix my sleep due to a elimination diet, certain daily habits and doing all meditation and breathwork stuff earlier the day.  


But i feel like it is not enough, i feel like i have to pro actively HEAL something inside of me, i'm so so anxious that this is the state of being for the rest of my life now. I love being in solitude and gaming and my work are the things i'd consider my main lifestyle. I have some social interaction on the weekends with my partner but that's about it, but on the surface that is enough for me.  


So my plan is to pause all stressful games and give whatever needs some recovery time inside of me some rest. I won't stop work but i thought i stop having podcasts and stuff running in the back as i seem to get easily overstimulated right now.

Those familiar with my work will often see me mention various “Crucial Factors” pertaining to the efficiency and productivity of an Individuals Process of Awakening and Self-Initiation into life’s many mysteries… With that said, here I will describe and present yet another one of these highly essential factors…. I call this one “Attitude Towards the Experience” (A. T .T .E).

This is one aspect of the process, which has a direct and very significant effect upon the Overall quality of an Individuals experience… as well as upon their ability to get the most out of any given situation, no matter how seemingly fruitless or mundane the circumstance may be…

Navigating the current system that is in play, can very easily become discouraging in many ways if one does not make the necessary adjustments within their everyday lives… perhaps even especially for the Awakening Individual who can begin to see just how far the endless suppression and control of knowledge and life in general, has truly gone.

Though, with this ever-growing Awareness and In-depth perspective on such incredibly rare areas of life, comes a very real responsibility, you might even say a Necessity, for the Individual at hand to Apply and Integrate these rare insights into the different areas of their lives and conduct, in a healthy and beneficial way… as opposed to letting them drive one to any variety of unstable and unbeneficial mental states/Conditions (Depression, Anxiety, Fear, Paranoia etc.)… which is something I have seen all too often.

After one’s idea of “Reality” is shattered, which is an absolute must on the path of Awakening… it is then Important to Assimilate this deepened Perspective… One must begin to rebuild and reprogram their daily conduct, Attention and decision making, in accordance with these various degrees of Insight… and do so in a manner which reflects a Passionate and Inspired Outlook towards the process… even within all the darkness and chaos which surrounds the present age… in the sense that “we have now identified the issue and can begin to transmute this into growth, through proper Thought and Action.”

For the freshly awakening Individual, who is in the midst of their first in-depth assessments of the “state of the world”, it is quite easy to feel overwhelmed by this energy of suppression and deceit which governs so efficiently a society, which at first glance, screams “Lost Cause” … However, it is important for one to realize that despite the Mass Ignorance and Lack of Awareness… despite the unbelievable depth of the Corruption and Deceit… those Individuals who are capable of coming to these In-depth realizations, hold the potential to play a hugely significant role… you could even say a “Divinely Significant” role towards ushering in the New Age and bringing the Collective into a much more Efficient and Spiritually Aware state of Existence…

One who finds themselves in this rare position, will soon realize the Intimate and fascinating relationship between their Internal Nature, and the World around them… As Above, So Below… As Within, so Without… Ones Experience is a direct product of their own Internal Conditions(Spiritual and Psychological) whether they be perspectives, attitudes, emotions, habits, addictions, depression, anxiety, pessimism or any other of a wide range of Internal phenomena… therefor when an Individual begins to embody this deepened perspective and Increased co-creative potential, they will being to see more and more of that which they regularly give their energy and attention to, expressed outward in their daily experience… the Internal, reflected outwards, with Intimate and precise fashion.

Attention and Effort towards any particular Emotion, Internal Condition, Thought, perspective etc., attracts and yields direct experiences which are of like resonance… The Individual who is susceptible to depression, actively feeds, encourages and brings forth like-phenomena into their lives when they give in to it… and the same goes for all different manner of Influence and energetic resonance, at both ends of the spectrum… One with a natural (spiritual and mental) resilience to outside influence has a great advantage in this area.

It is Important for one to not spend time dwelling upon “in the wrong light”, the endless nonsense which surrounds them… no matter how downright flabbergasting it might be at times… it is important to not “Take offence” to this deepened perspective into the majority of the worlds Ignorant state of being… but to instead carefully observe, analyze and Integrate the many present Insights pertaining to how and why this lack of awareness has come about, its wide variety of manifestations within everyday life and how they can begin to participate in the deceptive tactics as little as possible within their own behavior.

The degree of an Individuals “Presence of Mind” within any given moment, greatly determines their amount self-control and Awareness of their own Conduct… as well as their ability to extract Knowledge and Insight from within any given Experience/Circumstance. Therefor the Individual who embodies an unsavory attitude and deminer towards their daily lives, and who is highly susceptible in nature to outside Influence, misses out on endless Insight and opportunity… simply because they do not believe or even consider, that it could possibly be present within such a mundane existence… and is thus living a much less in-depth and lower quality of life, as compared to the Awakening Individual who is constantly looking for opportunities towards growth and development within every situation… even within mundane social Interactions and the chaotic work flow… keeping an optimistic outlook towards the experience as a whole, hardships and ALL…

Every Sentient being… especially One who finds themselves on a dedicated path of awakening, should view their overall experience of life, as if it were the absolute most Intimate and Important Relationship of which they will ever take part in… and indeed it should be... this relationship should take priority, for it is the source and cause behind all else that they will perceive in this life.

Bond with this Experience… with its darkness and its light… show it Love, Compassion, Patience and Genuine Effort, and this will Indeed make its way into being reciprocated within ones life… However, treat it with dread, doubt and neglect… then this too will be reciprocated.

Much Love

The idea of struggle starts fading -  

Once you see that you can not feel satisfied, relieved about result, about tomorrow now.

Once you see that you can not remove, undo the fear of going wrong, of committing errors.

When you do not shy away from the psychological discomfort of facing loss, defame, failure.  

When you see that you can not secure the comfort of having flawless choices.  

When you are not inclined to, addicted to entertainments, intoxications, holidays, religious-spiritual ideas, activities to cover up irritating, discomforting feelings, uncertainty you experience in daily life.  

Energy remains concentrated.  

In any action, fear of failure arises, fear of committing errors arises. Can you feel this fear, this uncertainty? This fear can not be acted upon, nor can it be escaped. When you see this, whole energy is concentrated here, passion for action is automatically generated. Either this fear remains covered up or we gloss over it with comforting explanations. Energy is dissipated.  

Your work is not to do something difficult or to solve complicated problems. Your whole adventure is to feel settled in whatever the situation is. You essentially feel settled when you see that any difficulty, any problem is psychological discomfort (if not immediate physical danger). To acknowledge ‘as it is’ is the key. The solution, the doing happens.

You can not experience anything without contrast. You can experience certainty against uncertainty, pleasure, relief against pain, discomfort, clarity against ambiguity, what you get against what you want and so on.

Every time contrast is being created between ‘what you want’ and ‘what happens or what you think should happen’. You have to be comfortable with this contrast, this gap, this discomfort, if you call it so. This contrasting process is life, it never stops.

The comfortableness with contrast puts you on the fluid ground, the ground of all possibilities. Lets you drop the idea of struggle.

The idea of hard work also drops. Your whole energy is concentrated in what you want or want to do.

# The Problem

Imagine this scenario: You're facing a stressful period maybe it's those daunting exams that hold your future in the balance. You're overwhelmed by the fear of failure constantly worrying about the outcomes and trying to control every aspect of your life. This constant pursuit of external success and the need for things to go your way is causing you immense emotional pain and anxiety. Sound familiar?

&#x200B;

# The Solution

There's a powerful solution to this problem and it doesn't involve any magic tricks or complicated rituals. It's all about embracing the present moment. Here's how:

# Personal Example

Let's break it down with a personal example. Imagine you're stressing over an upcoming project deadline just like I did recently during my studies. You're consumed by fear worrying about success or failure and overthinking every detail. But then you find out your project partner has already submitted the draft and received positive feedback. All that fear and anxiety you experienced turned out to be unnecessary. The situation resolved itself without your constant worry.

&#x200B;

# Why You Should Care

Living in the present moment isn't just a fancy concept. It's a practical tool for a happier and more fulfilling life. Here's why you should care:

&#x200B;

\- Find inner peace by letting go of attachment to external outcomes.

As of writing this I'm definitely feeling somatic disconnection; I have a headache, and I feel tense and anxious. I am not in flow state, and I am uncertain whether trying to fin d an answer to this will help me return to it. But it's worth a try.,

I have a transparent inferiority complex, a vicious tendency to 'compare and despairs', and I shame spiral quickly when I fail or am rejected. (Or perceive rejection) IU also quickly have my fight/flight activated if I perceive somebody as more dominant and authoritative than myself, more powerful (which is a lot of people.) My general response is either flight or fawn. Given I'm an adult man this is generally seen as pitiful and unattractive, so my anxiety is a core shame.

The main ways I've seen people suggest overcoming insecurity, low self esteem and particularly insecurity about my own anxiety/ neuroticism/competency levels etc. seem lacking:

\* ‘Surrender to God/god-principle/\[insert religion/spirituality/faith. The Good is the Absolute, Eternal and unchanging, and the Absolute is God. God is Everything and Everything is God.’

\-> This isn't working for my inner rationalist or empiricist, at least my younger self found the account of God unsatisfying, which is what set me on my existential journey) Most of my peers would place a profoundly high bar on justification for being allowed to consider yourself intelligent or moral and still have faoith.

To the extent it works (i.e. there is sufficient proof of God, so far there hasn't been), I am far from God, I am a maggot before God. So it is not true to say God is in everything.

\* ‘Don’t worry, just be yourself’

\-> Complete and utter bullshit. Ended up with me being a laughing stock or red flag user on certain subreddits and forums I’m no longer welcome in. People treat me differently to others (with less respect), there has to be a reason for this.

\* ‘Improve yourself. Accept that the only thing which manifestly Matters is power; that you are not good enough as you are and that you must become. The process of change, the striving towards greatness, that is your raison d'etre. Nothing less is acceptable.

\-> This is one I'm attached to, and have been since I was…13 probably? I've been immersed in ancient thought on the subject. But my actions as an adult speak otherwise. I like to THINK I'm humble but I sense my pride reeks. I speak too much, share my mind too much, react too much, reassure myself too much. I think my life is important, when part of me wonders if I should have been dead years ago. But also, part of me hurts when I acknowledge my own lesser-ness, incompetency, neuroticism. I want to kill that part. I don’t want to be controlled by feelings which limit me to inferiority.

\* ‘Accept that we are all uncertain and insecure and just pretending to know what we're doing. Stop looking for authority and certainty outside of yourself, generate it within and hope this makes people more confident \*to be\* insecure and vulnerable around you.’

\-> Thi currently seems like a coping mechanism for inferiority; it presumes that nobody exists worthy of authority, and likewise nobody who demonstrates that they ought to bow. Yet many exist who have that capacity, and many who lack (such as myself). Yes, some are sophists and demagogues, but many more have earned the capacity. Power exists, I deny it mattering because I am weak and lacking.

'Create your own values'--you don't get it. I don't think I am worthy (yet) of creating my own value system. My thoughts aren’t coherent enough to structure into the sophisticated logic which I require in order to be satisfied with my values. I want my values down as an analytic. I want them to be verifiable and falsifiable. I want them to mean something beyond my own childish imagination. They have to make sense to SOMEONE ELSE, and it’s so rare for someone else to understand (let alone agree with) my twisted thought processes that it just seems easier to surrender myself to the external. This is true when I am upset and distressed, but also true when I am happy; I become like an excitable child then, saying and doing things before I realise it.

'Then be better then'--for whatever reason, I can't right now --and I deserve to be hurt for this until I realise my potential to Be better (because this is the main way to honour the truth that some value systems and characters are honourable while others are wretched)

\* Don't even 'think' about the problem of hierarchy and social value which you frequently tortue yourself over; simply Live and let your values be embodied in action before thought.’ -> This I am trying to work towards. And it’s hard. The entire time I am living, there are so many triggers that remind me of my own inadequacy. I find that I am particularly vulnerable to people who project effortless dominance over their environment, to the authoritarians, to the people fearless to tell others to stand down, back off. Spirituality gurus who talk a lot about 'ego' can get under my skin and I am pretty fragile about 'mediocre men/bar is low for men/men are useless children' esque feminist vents. There is a part of me which wants to argue and another part which thinks that I will be \*either\* upsetting the natural order to do so \*or\* enabling fascism.

I’m a bit of a pain in the ass for therapists, which reinforces the idea of my Otherness. They keep treating this as a self esteem issue or some form of disability or neurodivergence stigma (internalised ableism is a concept in vogue now.) The thing is the narrative doesn’t add up with my actions, which are borderline hedonistic impulsivity, or I would have actually taken steps to DEMONSTRATE my lesser-ness. I haven’t actually self harmed or had suicidal ideation in years, so whatever me saying “I am inferior to others and “ isn’t entirely true, so presumably I am attention seeking or thinking that saying I am bad/weak makes it acceptable \*to\* be bad/weak. When it doesn’t. I always try to move the earth with my mind, for better or worse, and it has yet to happen.

I’m hoping this will be accepted here because I usually scare people off with my ‘unhealthy’ thought process.I tend to mask it in person or try to drown it out, because anybody exposed to it for too long tends to react with some level of anxiety. (I have at least one friend who thinks I have a serious and treatment-resistant case of OCD mixed in with my anxiety)

I am very lucky that my c8urrent therapist IS autistic and trained with ND, willing to put up with my BS

I am sorry, but I will type in a confusing manner. 

I have never attempted to examine myself from my own perspective. I’ve always chased after virtual persons, false ideals, the '5 am club of 26 hours a day of straight productivity and sleeping 3 minutesm which often are more than enough to last you 4 days without sleep' . I’ve never had the chance nor given myself the opportunity to make an assessment of who I am. So I’ve based who I am on the information fed to me by other people. If it’s negative. Little by little I feel worse. If it’s positive I become obsessed with the person that is feeding me positive thoughts about myself. 

It's rather funny how you wish to be at the place of someone else and would give a lot to be them on their worst days, when there are so many people that would do the same to be at yours. To wear the very shoes u have. 

It's quite pathetic really. We are all slaves of desire. But what lay beyond desire is futility. So where does one find the balance in this sick duality? 

If there is no desire, there is nothing to aim for, nothing to enjoy. It's just a flatline, but too much desire also doesn't allow you to enjoy anything, because you cannot see what you have, but only that which you do not. 

How does one find the balance without slipping too much to either side?

Also how can I see myself in my own eyes? How can I abolish the mental prison I built for myself and remove the augmented reality I have built to preserve my fragile ego. No. It's the opposite it doesn't preserve anything. The sick reality that I've created in my mind is of acidic nature. It'll destroy anything I try to build. Any string of positivity will be eaten away, eroded and torn apart. Leaving nothing but scrap.

How did I get to this point... hahaha. There's nothing, but an ocean of acidic negativity in me. Inferiority so great that only ambitions beyond my capabilities can make my day to day bearable. 

This quote from Dark on netflix really struck a cord ""Pain is their ship. Desire their compass"". It's painfully true. Whoever wrote that movie must've found the best dmt on the planet. 

&#x200B;

I've no idea how to look at myself thru another point of view or how to be easy on myself. I've demanded of myself an incredibly high standard for a long time that I could not maintain for a really long time as well. Which would prompt me into going into despair, then trying to make it up - the time i wasted, which would in turn burn me out even more, prompting me to waste more time and feel even worse... Until I eventually turned to addiction to ease the stress. WHich in turn became even worse and for a very long time this became an almost unbreakable cycle. In which I did things that I really wish I didn't.

And now that I finally have moderate control over my own head and actions I opted to make up for the things I screwed up and half assed. For the time I wasted. Ironically starting a new cycle. Following my desire... But I have tried the opposite. Nihilism. The endpoint of desire, there's nothing after desire, nothing but futility and desire for self-deletion.

&#x200B;

So in turn the standard has now been increased. I manage to reach it on some days. On some I do not and I beat myself up for it. Which burns me out a bit, but it's nothing I am not used to. I've turned into my own slave and abusive master. It's quite a perverse thing to do. 

&#x200B;

I think I am the byproduct of the confusion caused by modern society and the conflict of too many opinions being valued over my own. So now I've nothing, but desire, inferiority and an impossible standard to try and uphold. 

I built my own private prison, fully realising that I was doing so, and when I finished it and locked the bars. I threw the key 10 meters in front of the cage and now I cannot escape the prison. And no one can help me, because this prison is in my head where no one else will ever be. And now I sit in it unaware of who I am.

&#x200B;

Life can throw some serious curveballs at us, and we all experience suffering in one form or another - be it stress, anxiety, or sadness. But here's the thing: running away from it doesn't often bring the relief we seek. 

&#x200B;

**Why should you care?**

Imagine being able to find inner peace, even in the midst of life's toughest challenges. Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, it's not, and it doesn't require superhuman abilities or mystical rituals. It's all about surrender, and it's a powerful concept that can transform your life.

&#x200B;

**Suffering**

Suffering is a universal experience. We've all been there, dealing with emotional pain, loss, or simply the daily grind that wears us down.

&#x200B;

**Surrender**

Surrendering doesn't mean giving up; it means accepting things as they are and not fighting against the current. Here's how you can embrace surrender in your life:

&#x200B;

**1. Accept the present moment as it is**

Instead of constantly dwelling on the past or worrying about the future, focus on what's happening right now. This simple shift in mindset can bring immense peace.

&#x200B;

**2. Embrace your suffering**

Rather than trying to escape or numb your pain, confront it head-on. Allow yourself to feel your emotions without judgment. This act of acceptance can lead to clarity and eventual liberation from suffering.

&#x200B;

**3. Practice mindfulness**

Become more aware of your inner world by practicing mindfulness. It's like taking a step back and observing your thoughts and feelings without getting entangled in them.

&#x200B;

**4. Turn suffering into a state of presence and serenity**

When you fully embrace your suffering and accept it as part of your life's journey, you can transform it into a source of strength and serenity.

&#x200B;

**Why should you try this?**

Imagine the freedom that comes from letting go of the burdens that hold you back. Surrender isn't a sign of weakness; it's a path to strength and enlightenment.

&#x200B;

**Examples**

\- Have you ever faced a challenging situation and found solace in simply accepting it and letting go of resistance?

\- Share your experiences with embracing surrender in tough times and how it transformed your perspective.

&#x200B;

**Your Action**

Give it a shot! Try embracing surrender in your life, even in small ways, and see how it impacts your well-being. Come back and share your thoughts and experiences with us.

I would usually get out of bed and distract myself with something else, desperately hoping to get tired enough to sleep at least for a few hours. But there was this one time when I decided not to get up, and I recalled this instruction in a mindfulness course which advised us to simply watch and be with our sensations. 
In that moment I just did that, and something entirely different happened. Surrendering and accepting these feelings, I watched them dissolve into nothing. Then a whole new sense of peace and abandon came to me and i slept fantastically. The day after I felt so so different. I was just exuberant and smiling for no reason. People responded to me differently. It was only when I came in contact with some spiritual teachings i understood that there is a concept of disidentifying.

I found that journalling is super helpful for mindfulness, but Ive felt a big reason people (including muself) don't do it consistently is it takes too much effort to express all your thoughts in writing and starting from a blank piece of paper can be intimidating.

Now, I will add that when I first started mountain biking, I cried and walked everything 3 times on a green trail. 
And I can now ride most black rated trails with ease. 
I have progressed immensely since I started 6 years ago. 

I have had lessons on how to drop and it is within my skill level. 
If the drop is tiny (say 1-2ft) and ""no consequence"" my brain is cool with that but add any height (say 3-4ft) and my brain tells me I am not good enough and that I can't do it. 

I'm working on it. I've tried affirmations (I'm still doing this), I've tried nuerofeedback, hypnotherapy and counseling. 
I just can't seem to break through the barrier and believe in myself.

End result is a great book for anyone wanting to learn the basics of mindfulness while dealing with college life, and the students gain real-world value from their expensive educations!

 

Hey Reddit,

So I’m a college professor who can’t stand the skyrocketing costs of education. College has become a bad value proposition in a lot of ways. But this problem has been inspiring and I'm here to share something I've become deeply passionate about: creating real value in higher education and making sure hard work pays off.

On most days, I DO NOT believe that what we offer in higher education is worth the students' time or money.

Today is NOT one of those days. I've never been prouder of a publication than I am of That's Deep.

Two years ago, I began teaching a Mindfulness course (among my other courses) because I believe Mindfulness imparts essential life skills that will empower my students during college and throughout their lives. Teaching them to connect their breathing with their emotions, and to align these with their professional, vocational, and personal goals, is more important than lecturing on the emic/etic distinction or Michel Foucault. While Foucault is fun, there are levels of importance in the knowledge we impart.

In tandem with the mindfulness course, I devised a method to streamline evaluation and expectations in the classroom. My aim was to make the stakes of coursework more significant while ensuring I never burdened my students with busywork. Post-Covid, I'm done with wasting time—mine or theirs.
 
So, without seeking permission from my chair or dean, I taught the students how to write a book, and today, they brought it to market.

That's Deep: A Mindfulness Guide for College Students is a game-changing book authored by the talented students from my Mindfulness class, under the pen name Lule West. It is a comprehensive guide designed for today’s college student, covering topics from exam stress to social life, equipping them to thrive both during and after college. It also includes eight free audio mindfulness exercises! Essentially, they wrote the book we all wished would have existed for the course. But it’s not a dull textbook. We made a point to write the book they’d buy even if they weren’t taking the course.

We're doing more than just talking the talk; we're walking it right into the marketplace. The students' final grade hinges on the real-world success of their book. My course is now this wild combo of project management and mindfulness, giving students brag-worthy resume boosters: ""Published Author"" and ""Project Manager.""

The cherry on top? They get royalties from every sale—straight-up equity for their work. We're equipping students with the chops to create standout work and to make sure they're fairly compensated for their efforts. This could be the future of higher education, and I'm stoked to play a part in it.

I'm betting the students are as proud of their work as I am. And to all the parents out there, this is the kind of college investment that pays dividends in more ways than one.

So, Redditors, help me celebrate these young authors who have written a book worth buying for yourself and your college student. Pick up a copy of That's Deep, drop a review on Amazon, and spread the word to anyone college-bound or currently navigating the college chaos. It's more than a book; it's a tool for empowerment through mindfulness.",False,That's Deep,1.0,https://amzn.to/3tIo8iM

I perform guided meditation a few times a day. During a 10 minute interval, a speaker prompts me several times to think about various aspects of my breath.

I noticed that sometimes I stay aware of my breath until the next prompt, other times my mind wanders and comes back, and yet other times it doesn't come back.

I was curious how this evolves over time, and thought of using tally marks in the margin of my journal. It requires opening my eyes and using the pencil, but works very well for me! The marks being next to my thoughts lets me see if there are any long-term patterns.

So far I've been using it for a week. The past two nights I've slept less than usual, and I can tell from the marks that I became less mindful. The same happens later in the day. So, sleep is very important, and it's easy to quantify for yourself!

Until recently, when I screwed up at work. There was simply no excuse. I just wasn’t working hard enough, and instead was “gentle” and “understanding” as I struggled with fear and procrastination. And now I’ve blown a deadline in a publicly humiliating way. This would easily be cause for firing if my immediate supervisor learns of it, which they still might.

With the benefit of mindfulness, I recognized the feeling of anger and shame from childhood, and it clicked: I learned to hate myself and hold onto the feeling because I would fuck up if I relaxed and forgot to work harder.

Now, all I can think is I was correct in the first place. I feel like if I had remembered this feeling, and not been “gentle” with myself, I would have worked harder and not been on the brink of professional disaster.

The harder we try to stop thinking about something the deeper it digs it’s claws into our mind, and this is an unfortunate mark of being human - however we must understand that our thoughts and us are not one and the same, and need not define us nor speak to our character  - some of our thoughts are as nonsensical as our dreams, and our emotions are mere suggestions of reality rather than well calibrated responses.

 Consequently we should not attempt to immediately smother and suppress unpleasant thoughts since that will exacerbate them, but instead we should acknowledge them for what they are, and let them pass through our mind as water under a bridge without empowering them - even the recurrent and extremely negative ones will lessen eventually.

Correct me if I’m wrong with that assessment. 

However there seems to be another train of thought that runs somewhat contrariwise to this one which is promoted in a lot of self improvement and pulp psychology literature: 

That there is a saving grace in that we are easily distractible, and so we do have the ability to supplant destructive thoughts with more productive thoughts or behaviours whenever they arise. 

For instance you’ve had a horrible breakup and you’re having intrusive thoughts about hurting them: you can set a habitual response where whenever you have such a thought you immediately begin to think about your favourite poetry or quotes from your favourite sitcom or the happiest time that you’re grateful for - or you head to the gym or call a friend or go pat your dog or even start playing a video game. Ideally a constructive response. And over time the frequency of the intrusive thoughts should decrease.

To me these techniques are at odds but perhaps they’re not as contradictory as they seem.

And then some I know say that the only way to really combat frequent negative intrusive thoughts is via psychiatric medication. Or that meditation won’t be sufficient for many people.

I’m a bit of an over thinker however. Well not a bit, a lot really. An anxious person. Which leads to a low esteem and confidence issue. Plus lots of doubt. However I’ve been mindful of it, and at times don’t identify with those traits.

But it does make overthink this mindfulness thing as well. 

As the question says, what exactly should be the thoughts you do actually take into consideration,

For example. Say you’re at home, sitting. A thought pops up to your mind. 

“I should go play Elden Ring”. And you do. You find something to do. Enjoy your video game. It brings you some kind of satisfaction.  

Another time, a thought pops up. “I’ve been gaining wait and I’m technically overweight, I should hit the gym and lose weight”. And so you do. And you lose 30 lbs 3 months later and feel better mentally and physically. 

Or another thing, a thought pops up “I’d like to read more about a subject I like, which is Roman History”. So you go on Amazon and buy SPQR and read all of it. And you enjoy every single page because of its great written overview of Roman history. 

See what I’m getting at ? It’s like we’re being mindful so we can detach from our ego and not be our thoughts and emotions. Not identify with them.

Excerpt - Eckhart Tolle ‘The dreamer and the dream’ A New Earth

Honestly every time I read his books, it’s like I’m reading them for the first time. Any book like that, is a book of truth. 

This is from A New Earth, page 210. 

“Nonresistance is the key to the greatest power in the uni-verse. Through it, consciousness (spirit) is freed from its imprisonment in form. Inner nonresistance to form-Whatever is or happens—is a denial of the absolute reality of form. 

Resistance makes the world and the things of the world appear more real, more solid, and more lasting than they are, including your own form identity, the ego. It endows the world and the ego with a heaviness and an absolute importance that makes you take yourself and the word very seriously. 

The play of form is then misperceived as a struggle for survival, and when that is your perception, it becomes your reality.
The many things that happen, the many forms that life takes on, are of an ephemeral nature. They are all fleeting.


Things, bodies and egos, events, situations, thoughts, emo-tions, desires, ambitions, fears, drama ... they come, pretend to be all-important, and before you know it they are gone, dissolved into the no-thingness out of which they came. Were they ever real? Were they ever more than a dream, the dream of form?


When we wake up in the morning, the night's dream dissolves, and we say, ""Oh, it was only a dream. It wasn't real?"" But something in the dream must have been real otherwise it could not be. When death approaches, we may look back on our life and wonder if it was just another dream. Even now you may look back on last year's vacation or yesterday's drama and see that it is very similar to last night's dream.


There is the dream, and there is the dreamer of the dream. The dream is a short-lived play of forms. It is the world relatively real but not absolutely real. Then there is the dreamer, the absolute reality in which the forms come and go. The dreamer is not the person. The person is part of the dream. The dreamer is the substratum in which the dream appears, that which makes the dream possible. It is the absolute behind the relative, the timeless behind time, the consciousness in and behind form. The dreamer is consciousness itself—who you are.


To awaken within the dream is our purpose now. When we are awake within the dream, the ego-created earth-drama comes to an end and a more benign and wondrous dream arises. This is the new earth.”

Like thoughts and the feeling of control would be gone and I would not be conscious in my own mind anymore.

One way that I was never taught, but that definitely works for me (and I am sure there must be others that have realized this as well of course, just not that I have come across it) is comparing an experience to itself.

This works on the theory that there is the mental layer, of the thinking mind, and then there is the raw experience layer, of direct experience. They are two sides of the same coin, but can be seen as distinct from each other for practical purposes.

The mind makes the map to represent the raw experience layer so that it can make a functional understanding of it, and it does so by comparing and contrasting, relating things to each other. In short, a relative working map of reality, but limited to concept. When it is allowed to continue comparing and contrasting, it will do so, and it will be a hindrance to mindfulness which is about resting on the primary source of raw experience as it is occurring. Of course, the mental layer has its purpose and we need it to function, but it has the habit of bouncing off the primary source of experience by comparing it to the mental map and then making ideas about it.

So, one trick that I have found (that I am sure other's will have too, as mentioned above) is to compare the experience of something to itself.

This bypasses the mental layer which works by comparing things to other things in order to build its relative map of reality.

It can be applied to objects and experiences in any of the senses, including the mind sense (mental states and mental objects).

It can, of course, be applied to the experience of breathing.

But it can also be applied to any experience, such as the experience of anything that the body is doing, as well as anything felt, seen, thought, smelt, tasted, and so on.

I discovered it some time ago through testing different ways to interpret original mindfulness texts, but I have only realized how widely it can be applied recently.

It can be applied to something in experience that is relatively static, as well as something in experience that is noticeably moving and changing.

One can test it now by choosing something that one is experiencing, and comparing that experience to itself.

Compare, for example, the experience of breathing as it is occurring now, to the experience of breathing as it is occurring now.

Constructive feedback is welcome.

Disclaimer: I should probably put here that you should only try this when it is a safe situation to experiment with mindfulness and meditation techniques, if you do decide to test it (although I am sure you already know that).

Edit: Of course this is simply a tool to focus the mind on a target mindfulness object and especially the experience aspect, and it is not a whole system of mindfulness. It is just something that might be useful when needed for this purpose. I have found it especially useful for focusing on the breathing more easily and one pointedly with less struggle. It seems to work really well for concentrating on a single sense object, penetrating to the experience level more rapidly and staying there with more ease. You can compare any object or experience that is currently being experienced to itself to get this effect, or at least that is what I have found while doing it, and I have had feedback from two others now that this has worked for them, too.",False,An interesting 'way in' to mindfulness: comparing an experience to itself,0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/190r2p8/an_interesting_way_in_to_mindfulness_comparing_an/

This continued for the whole summer, and winters are sad in general. I drank a lot and ate a lot. I would finish a tub of ice cream in one night. I gained 20 pounds and lost my self-confidence. 

I was so angry with myself that I became a very closed person. Sleeping got difficult with every passing week. I started to smoke to cope up. I wasn't sure what was wrong but I wanted to come out of it. One good thing was that I had a supportive employer and I didn't get fired. 

Then, I was diagnosed with ADHD in August and now few things started to make sense. I started to see a therapist and that helped me. I had a few good days and that gave me some hope. 

I decided to get my life back on track in October. I started to read books. I am grateful to Reddit for all the motivatiing stories I read. I started going back to lifting weights once in a while. I threw away cigs and junk food but they kept coming back. My therapists asked me to start small. 

I was feeling so alone in December with all the holidays. I felt I completed a full circle. I was making some progress but I decided to completely turn around from new year. 

It has been just a week, but I am elated that this is the first week that I went without smoking. I was decently consistent across other things like waking up early, taking vitamins, working out, drinking water, writing a journal. 

My therapists was a huge help.She asked me to track my day and share the weekly progress from this app, Habityou. Now, I just need to be consistent and stay motivated.

“Each moment is so rich with details. And just savoring ALL of that moment is so delicious. Every moment has a journey in your brain. You can start on a moment and react negatively to it and disassociate you’re because you would not want enjoy it. This will mean that you’re wasting your precious life. The moment is inevitable. Whether you disassociate for it or not. By disassociating with that moment you’re robbing yourself of the sheer joy of experiencing life. Life is going by…. By distracting yourself you’re changing nothing and learning nothing. Even if a moment is tough. You can still be 100% in the moment and still take it all of good that life offers and the lessons that by you “feeling” a certain way changes nothing about reality. You experience each moment. Good and bad. Without reacting to it, because that reaction isn’t adding any value to your life but it is robbing you of some. 

So what’s the point of a negative reaction? A negative or a false reaction is so counterproductive. The time you’re wasting in inventing narratives just to placate your own ego. Is the time you can use to just live on and keep experiencing the richness of life. 

I don’t know if there’s something wrong with me that I can 


One never slows down enough for any moment to register. Because in the entire moment you keep bouncing false narrations / excuses / negative reactions. To what end?

You should just accept whatever life offers each moment with humility and just live that moment fully. Because how long you will live isn’t even guaranteed. It could be 50 more years or someone might hit you while crossing the street on your way to work in two days. If you are dying, and you’re on your last few moments. What are you worried about? Your work? The dick that cut you off on your way back from work? That video game? Your mom? Your ambitions? Your bucket list? That you’re pissed your favorite show got canceled? The best moments of your life? The adventures you got lucky with?

People die every day in car accidents that weren’t even their fault. They were just plane unlucky to get hit vehicle driven by rash driver or you could get a terminal disease. What good what your mental arithmetic, egoistic reactions, negative reactions, excuses? Just take the next best best step forward in each moment and you’ll catch up to your desired state sooner compared to wasting time and losing momentum by not chasing after this very moment immediately. By not accepting this moment, you’re just impeding your own progress. All you’re doing by existing is:

“wanting to learn how to get better” —>
“getting some ideas” —> 
“try to implement some” —>
“fail at it” —>
“react negatively, loose momentum” —> 
“resort to living like a slob” —> 
“waste away on my phone” —>
“hit rock bottom” —>
“Slowly start feeling the desire to improve again” —>
“wanting to learn how to get better”
 
and repeat…….

Why not just choose to live? Take lows exactly for what they are and not add your negative reactions to it. And take the highs with humility. You’re fortunate enough to experience it at all. Not many people get that chance. A person could be from New York or New Delhi they would love some aspects of their lifestyle and life quality and some aspects that they would hate. In either case, there are people who are way less fortunate compared to them and are currently living in terror or disaster. Barely managing to survive. They could be in countries like Palestine, Ukraine, North Korea, Japan to name a few in today’s depressing world.

It is a blessing that you have a phone you can read this on and what you consider “problems” in life and someone else’s ambition / goal in life to get back to or maybe even achieve for the first time. Can you imagine your fortunes? You enjoy a comparatively luxurious life style. But you also waste it. But not really enjoying it. Instead you choose to fill a third of it lost in the desire of hunting the next best thing in your life. Maybe a third nursing a negative reaction to something or someone. The final third disassociating yourself with reality because you just happen to like it as much. 

What a waste of life and intellect. You need to slow down and not rush every moment. Just live it. Appreciate your wins when they come to you. While you’re working towards it to become a better version of yourself. 

Appreciate the brilliant coincidence that made you read my words and share my moment with you on a planet suspended in a universe that we literally has 200 billion trillion stars. Forget stars you can’t even imagine how big 200 billion trillion number is. Go fucking slow. Take it ALL in. And most importantly keep moving in the right direction with all the knowledge you gain along the way. 

Hopefully you’ll then be able to solve bigger problems. Problems like the cure or cancer or problems like understanding yourself. No one in this world know what you want. Only you know what you want. And if you don’t know right now. No problem. That’s why you’re alive. You have an unknown duration left in your life to solve the two most important problems. Who are you? Why are you here? 

You just need to slow down experience the moment as it is in its entirety without reacting to it and continuing to give your best efforts in life to anything you do.”",False,Some of my thoughts have deeply caught my attention to these ideas…,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/18zqq38/some_of_my_thoughts_have_deeply_caught_my/

I came here to ask you some advice regarding trauma-based self centeredness (SC) deflation/dissolution. I am talking about having this thick self-centered layer in my subconscious level, therefore not being able to catch the pattern in action most of time, creating a lot of harm around me. I am conscious that it exists however, but not really able to bring it to the surface. 

Currently I am into shadow work and some other therapies, through which I ve made some progress in other domains. 

In this case however (SC), the situation is more problematic, almost critical, as I cannot find a way to be fully aware of my state of being. It affects my private life, the mental health of my partner and the future that we are trying to build together. I am giving some details below, through some core ideas, and what I see as the main fear behind each component: 

- The situation of helping others does not come to me naturally, and the only way to do it is by forcing myself through various means (reminders, notes, tongue guardian, programmed actions or events etc), which make me feel artificial, as I know it is not something coming in an easy and natural way. Most of the time, I put myself in the first place, regardless of the magnitude of the situation/action encountered. Even if it involves our family or our future baby.
I believe it is the fear of self-suffering that blocks me from helping others, as well as the fear of looking unprepared, weak or incompetent. 

- As I am senseless most of the time to the situation of other people, I have the urge to say/do something without thinking it thoroughly, which in my mind is a way of showing my partner that I care - in order to not look senseless. This most of the time backfires, as what I said/did is mostly superficial or illogical, and it could be against what we talked about / decided already. As a result, my partner thinks of me as phased out, immature and not willing to assume resposability for planning something together. Because it looks like I say something just to be there or that I don't care (I have to say about  my partnerthat she has a high level of awareness, possibily the highest I encounter in any human being in my life. This makes her so suceptible to false or artificial reasoning).
Here, I think it is the fear of not cause others suffering by being senseless that pushes me to say something, which provides exactly the opposite outcome 

I lack initiative, as I expect others to have it or guide me. I fear that my solution will not be appreciated, downgraded or will harm somebody.

Even with observing all this fears, and tracing their roots to a certain point, I still cannot get over the SC state.

As I said, I do not do it voluntarly or in a conscious mode. I pendulate between being passive & senseless and forcing myself to act when others get upset or hurt. As soon as the person(s) gets better, I again turn senseless. It makes me ill sometimes, as I do not want to be like this. Sometimes I believe that one thing I did not learn (until now) is how to love other beings, as I am not sure if I love myself properly. (Even if you see a lot of ""I"" pronouns around)

I see the same pattern in my family, were the paternal side seems unable to love and help the maternal one, which leads to a disbalance that they(my parents) accepted. I do not want to have a life like this, I know that I am capable of true love and support (as sometimes I am able to penetrate the layer of self-centeredness, I encounter joy, a clear vision of the future and I tend to get resposible naturally. Unfortunately, I cannot keep this state for lengthy periods of time). Extensive emotional damage and numerous traumas produce the background that causes all this is.

I tried and tried at things I wanted to succeed in and failed. Caused me to be negative and it created a loop where that energy causes me to fail. However, I've started to tell myself, I can do this, or I will do this, and saying today is the last day I'll have this issue. And my entire life has transformed, I feel like now whenever I wanted to achieve something, knowing I can makes me much more better at doing it then already giving up. I know this all sounds cliche the ""never give up"" advice but seriously it really has its roots because when you try to geniually look at situations and apporach things with a positive mindset, it changes the way your brain responds and preforms those tasks. To be specific for my situations, I struggle with adhd and even with medication and understand how to behave, I struggle with completing responsibilities at work, impusilvitity in the things I say, and as well as  hyperactivity. I can interupt and go on tangents without any regards for the other person. I only ever realize I do these things after the situation is over almost like the post game replay that shows what you did. I tried for so long to do figure out how to stop that behavior but I kept failing and failing and failing, and that depression put me in a place where I gave up trying cause I thought I'm already when I walk out this door instantly forget to behave the way I should behave. But it got to the point where my job was at risk cause my procrastination was preventing me from completing job tasks, and thst was truly a breaking point for me where I essentially realized the things I want in life, if its within reach then I can. Saying that I can, I will, I'm able to, and truly believing in myself no matter how many times I fail. Suddenly I was able to behave the way I wanted to behave, and take care of my work responbilies without issue, and not in short bursts but changes that are long lasting and continue to persist today. Obviously I'm not saying you can fly if you want to fly or do things that's extremely unlikely, or you won't fail, I'm saying if you truly tell yourself you can instead of cant, a lot of things that might seem hard, you'll find yourself able to do because your belief is subconsciously pushing yourself to do these things. The motivation the drive pushing you to do this as well as your ability to do these things are being positive and believing  you can.

That's how it starts. I'm not actively suffering. Nor do I have any somatic symptoms of something wrong.

I've done a lot of introspective self work and found that I am *so so disconnected and isolated* from the real world. It's unbelievable.

This is the first time in my life (i'm 25) where I can't say I belong anywhere or with anyone. When I'm around family I feel so so alone. Like I exist around them but I'm not really there. When I'm on my own, I sort of get fatigued from being around me all the time so I try to tune out by going on social media. Needless to say, that exacerbates things. And after hours of binging and mindless scrolling, I end up feeling emptier than before. 

Why am I like this? I knew I had a problem when I fell down the self-help/therapy rabbit hole a year ago. And I can confidently say that I'm not as miserable as I was and that I've accomplished big strides in the path of self acceptance. However, the one area where I fail to fix is the fact that I can't tolerate my own presence.

I can't focus 100% on anything I do for me, for my own sake. I don't even think I have interests at this point. Whatever media I happen to consume is a convenient distraction. My mind is always on. But my biggest problem is that I can't focus. I can't ***immerse into anything***. I am trying to find the words to express this properly. I have a voice in my head that won't shut up. It's always on. It's always droning on. 

I tried to analyze myself out of this mindset. I've tried to **feel** my way out of this mindset. I really really don't feel alive. I feel like I'm just dragging my body from one location to another and it's killing me slowly and silently. I don't even understand why I'm like this because I eat healthy, exercise, pray and try to improve every day. Yet my apathy and lack of concentration is becoming more acute by the day. I'm at the point where I really can't point at one concrete cause for my melancholy. It's just there. Forget the CBT/DBT/Affirmations/Religious litanies/rites. It's always there. **And I can always feel it.**

I'm not so bad that I need to get psychiatric help. And I've already accepted that I don't have the countenance for suicide. I'm just filled with a deep passive sadness at the prospect of living the rest of my life with this draining, incessant dark vortex of bad energy inside me.

From: Your Friend Money

When you wake up tomorrow, you will undoubtedly seek me out… immediately and without question.

For we both know very well that I AM the one who feeds your children… I AM the one who pays your bills… I AM your means of survival… I AM your stability and your confidence…

And without me, you are nothing but a burden to my mighty father who goes by the name of Materialism… and not only that, but without me, you are an embarrassment to yourself and to your reputation… as well as a disappointment to your family, who at the end of the day, needs me to survive much more than they need you…

If you ever decide to neglect me and the ceaseless pursuit for my body, I will leave you quick, fast and in a hurry… It is you who will suffer because of your disobedience to my presence, not me… I will continue ruling the world with an Iron Fist and a paperback…

So, now that you understand that I, money, take priority over all else in life… let me tell you, it isn’t all bad.

Imagine all the nice new things you can have if you would only obey and give into my superiority…

Think about all the attention you will get from others and the world around you, if you have me in your pocket, for I can turn even your arch enemy into the “best of friends” …

And I haven’t even mentioned… all the flashy, expensive distractions you could buy for yourself and your family… all I ask is that you spare me your Dignity…

The thing is that you need to do your practice every. single. day. Not joking - don't skip any day. 

I found out that meditating this way is helping me much much much more than if I would have meditated every other day or when just feeling like it.

The mindfulness just keeps on cultivating inside me, whereas I think that if I wouldn't do it daily, the mindfulness will ""go out"" on that little gaps where I don't meditate.

What if we anchored our emotional experiences in the conviction that we have at our disposal the means to alter them? What if, instead of cherishing our favorite visitors and turning away the others, we could “welcome them all and... treat each guest honorably,” as Rumi wrote centuries ago?

I tend to overthink and go in circles but it's leading to an actions and I'm just not doing anything too make a change. I understand change is good because it's a way of opportunity or a way of improving life, but it's this fixed mindset where the problem occurs. You start to know is your weak points and life is not good so you just tend to embrace it and not do anything about it. Just leads to more frustration like I'm unhappy then why am I not doing anything to make a change? Simple things like I want to get in shape but I don't feel any enthusiasm or can't find my why. Or even if I do find it I still don't do it. When it's time to face fears I keep telling myself I'll do it and I'm going to do this yet. I never take any actions on that either.

Thank you for understanding.

So I'm not usually one to post on here or anywhere really but everything right now is all unknown to me, the last couple weeks have been exceptionally difficult for me and I have been pushed further and further away from the happy life I am used to. I have been married for 5 years to the father of my children and aside from the occasional fights it's been mostly good times, well up until about a year ago when he moved us across the country away from everything and everyone I know so he could take a job working for a mine. Now the job paid good but proves to be extremely overwhelming and stressful. It had progressively gotten worse and worse and then it started getting taken out on myself and my children more and more first it was just yelling and then it started to get physical. The first time he hit me luckily the kids were in bed on the other side of the house and I was able to keep it from waking them up but my oldest daughter noticed the mark that was left on my face I of course told her that it was from trying to get a box down from the closet and there was a picture frame on top that slid off and hit me in the face but I'm not sure if she believed me I covered it with makeup from then on to avoid the questions from anyone else. The next time it happened was 2 weeks later (last Monday) and I was not as lucky that time and the kids were in the living room and heard everything and tried to come running in the room and my husband went to slam the door and he slammed my little girls fingers in the door and she started screaming and when I went to run to help her he slammed me up against the wall by my throat till I almost passed out when he finally let go I dropped to the ground and crawled over to my frantic children and held them as he just walked away without a bit of remorse or guilt for what he had done. That night after he had passed out (he had been drinking) I loaded up my children and whatever I could fit in the back of my little car and I left knowing that I have to get my kids away from him because it's only destined to get worse and who knows what he is capable of doing because after seeing the look in his eyes I don't even know who that man is. I drove all night long and I finally stopped when the kids woke up and we're hungry I was able to find a little motel that wasn't too expensive and not a total dump because I don't want to take my kids from there normal life and put them in a roach motel that will be another traumatic experience to add to the list this week but I can't afford to pay for a nice hotel I didn't have much money to begin with and my husband keeps all his money separate in his own account and only gives me enough money to pay the bills and that's it. I had made a little extra money on the side selling some clothes online but it was nothing that I can survive off for long at all. I went to the health and human services to try to get public assistance and told them the situation I am in but they seemed less than caring or concerned and said that I would get a call from a eligibility worker ""sometime soon"" and provided me with no more information than that. They were extremely unhelpful when I asked for resources that could help and I left there in tears with absolutely zero help and told I have to wait for the process to get help. WTF is the Point of asking for help if they are not going to help! I have maybe enough money to last a day maybe MAYBE 2 only if I am lucky and with the weekend here there is no sign of getting a call for assistance. I have absolutely no family or friends here and my family that lives in Illinois don't have the ability or funds to help me at all, lots of times I was sending them money to get by but now I'm so lost and broken and I can't let my babies see me break down but I refuse to go back to that monster and put my kids lives and my life in jeopardy. He has cut off my credit cards my phone I had to go get a cheap prepaid one at Walmart. I don't even know if this is where I want to settle down but I can't keep my kids out of school and I feel horrible for throwing them through a loop like this they are all having nightmares and all 3 are sleeping with me and refuse to sleep in the other bed. I just don't know what to do or where to turn for help so if anyone knows of any resources that I can turn to please let me know. I don't want to put my location for fear of him finding us but if you send me a direct message I can tell you in case you know of any resources that I can get even a little help from getting my feet grounded for my kids it would be a huge blessing like I said I'm not looking for a hand out just a hand up thank you for taking the time to hear my predicament I appreciate just being heard.

During this guided meditation (specifically: ""Allow thoughts to come and go""), this was one of the final lines he said and I didn't quite understand what it meant/how to put it into practice. I was happy to see it was the quote of the session!

During this session, one of the only thoughts that popped into my head was how a relative was going to be coming over tomorrow so I had to make sure I clean up. I can acknowledge being distracted by this thought because it is high on my to-do list tomorrow. But how do I ""relate to my thoughts"" in this respect? Is it why I think this is important, which is making sure I don't have embarrassing things out when a relative comes over, which can lead into how I care what people think of me/my space?

- Unable to rewind, fast forward, or select second specific time within the interface. 
- Unable to “stack” multiple SleepCasts (i.e., the next one would begin as the old one ends). 
- Unable to remove the “nighttime sounds” at the end of the SleepCast. 
- Unable to favorite certain SleepCasts, so always have to search for them which is especially annoying now that the SleepCast names have been changed.

I wrote a short story on Wattpad based on the Harvest Inn sleep cast. It takes about 1.5 hours to read and is a story based in England 1820 during the Regency Era(Jane Austen) time period. The description is below along with the link to Wattpad. 

Thomas Radcliff, Duke of Sussex, was anything but happy. His heart was recently broken by his childhood best friend who accepted a proposal to another man. His grief drives him to escape his Dukal duties during the autumn season to a nostalgic destination. Harvest Inn, a quaint countryside manor he'd spent many visits to with his family in the past was just the place. Fantasizing about riding horseback through the apple orchards and leisurely reading in the library in front of a roaring fireplace would be the cure to his broken heart. That is until he meets another Harvest Inn guest. Clara Beachum, an aspiring novelist interrupts his solitude with her intelligence and confidence, something he's never seen in a woman before. Will Thomas find a cure for his heartache? Or will the Harvest Inn draw him towards a new direction in his life?

My go-to companion throughout this journey has been my kit Withings device, which has been invaluable in helping me monitor [my calorie intake], among other things. However, like many of you, I've often felt that while the data it provides is immensely valuable, making sense of it all can sometimes be a bit overwhelming.

That's why I've been hard at work developing a software solution that aims to transform the way we use and benefit from this data. I envision a platform that seamlessly gathers information from different sources – whether it's [smart watches/rings], health apps, food diaries, workout trackers, sleep monitors, or stress management tools – and offers insightful AI-driven analysis that sheds light on how these pieces of information interact.

Imagine being able to visualize how your daily calorie intake influences your sleep quality, or how your exercise routine impacts your stress levels. This platform is designed to be a comprehensive hub where you can not only track various metrics but also gain personalized insights to guide your journey.

What's really exciting is the flexibility of customization. You'll have the freedom to tailor the platform to your specific needs, creating an experience that perfectly aligns with your goals and preferences.

I'm also planning to support a wide array of personal tracking apps and make our integration processes open source, so the community can contribute and enrich the platform. And privacy is paramount – we're implementing a secure closed-loop local data hosting approach that ensures your information remains completely confidential.

My target is to launch the initial version by August 31st, 2023. But before that, I'm reaching out to you, the r/caloriecount community. What features are you most excited about? Any specific functionalities you'd love to see? Whether you're concerned about data security, have thoughts on pricing, or simply want to share general feedback, I'm here to listen. My ultimate aim is to create a tool that truly resonates with the unique needs of this community.

In essence, I'm thrilled to introduce an app that empowers you to uncover the intricate connections between different aspects of your health journey. Think of it as a tool that helps you understand how your daily choices impact your progress – from how your dietary choices affect your sleep to how your workouts influence your overall well-being.

Your thoughts and opinions on this concept are incredibly valuable. Feel free to share your comments below or send me a message if you're interested in being part of the early access testing team. Let's collaborate to build something exceptional!

 I'm thrilled to share a project I've been passionately working on and would love to get your honest feedback and ideas.

Over the last few years, I've been on a journey to live a more intentional and healthier life by closely monitoring various aspects like health, sleep, diet, and stress. Just like the popular apps we use to track individual aspects (think MyFitnessPal, Noom, Garmin), they've been invaluable in their own ways, aiding me in keeping tabs on my exercise or diet. But there's always been a missing piece – the ability to weave these data points together and understand how my fitness and diet are intertwined with factors like productivity and stress levels. While I appreciate the data's value independently, I've often wondered how much richer the insights could be if I could actually use and analyze it in a holistic context.

This contemplation led me to embark on a journey of software development. For the past few months, I've been crafting a platform that harmonizes and visualizes data from a variety of sources. Imagine combining information from your smart devices, health apps, mood trackers, nutrition and exercise apps, sleep trackers, productivity tools, and more. The result? An abundance of AI-driven insights revealing intricate connections and influences among these different areas. Moreover, you can effortlessly log personal entries like your journal, energy levels, mental well-being, and anything else you wish to monitor, allowing you to uncover how each facet impacts the others.

This software serves as a central hub, empowering you to comprehensively track your life's spectrum and nurture your optimal self. Its flexibility is paramount, ensuring you can tailor it to your exact needs. My vision extends further – a wealth of personal tracking app integrations, coupled with open-sourced integration processes for you to personalize and share with fellow users. Ultimately, this tool aims to simplify the process of syncing your data (whether via integrations, manual inputs, or CSV imports), exploring it through experiments and generated insights, and charting your progress toward your ultimate goals, accompanied by motivational tips and techniques to guide you, especially during those challenging days.

One key tenet of my plan is to uphold absolute data security. I've designed a secure, closed-loop, locally-hosted data storage system where your information remains accessible only to you – not even I will have access.

As the final touches come together, I'm excited to announce that version one is set to launch on September 3rd. In the meantime, I'm eager to learn about the features you're most excited about and your broader ideas. I welcome your inputs on any aspect – from features you'd like to see prioritized, general thoughts, potential concerns, and even pricing considerations. This endeavor is fueled by a desire to create something that genuinely resonates with this community, so I warmly invite you to share your opinions.

So, the big question: Is this an app you would want to use? Would a tool that helps you untangle the intricate web of interactions within your life and provides a holistic understanding of your well-being be something that aligns with your goals? I value your insights immensely, and your opinion will play a crucial role in shaping the future of this endeavor.

But now I feel like it’s starting to have a negative impact. For example, noting when you catch yourself thinking. I run/walk several hours everyday since it’s what I do in my free time. For a few years I’ve been doing it without headphones and have been also seeing it as a chance to meditate. So that’s meditating or trying to practice mindfulness several hours a day for a few years. Now a big issue is over noting, since I think I habitually started doing it too much since the goal for the longest time was trying not to think. Still have no problem doc  it aly ing at work or with friends, or no problem being in the moment with them for the most part. Even when I’m watching tv I’m aware of how much my mind loses focus and is not even thinking about the show. How can you be super into a show if the thoughts going by are like radio chatter? Where it’s hard to get emotionally involved or passionate? 

I’ve noticed a lot of mindfulness seems to be the teachings you digest coming back as thoughts in your normal day, as well as consciously or unconsciously noting thoughts. A lot of times out on a walk I try not to note and do resting awareness and start to notice the resistance to thoughts because I see and feel the impacts of the mind noting really quickly and urgently m. It’s a really weird sort of awareness seeing it act in that manner.

My understanding is that meditation is the practice of cultivating awareness aka to be more mindful. Mindfulness is also accompanied with readings, teachings, etc. to help you learn how to be mindful even during times you’re not meditating. Being present doesn’t not mean not thinking, it means having the awareness to be in the present moment accompanied by whatever thoughts and feelings the mind is experiencing. I’ve done headspace pro about 10 times and the course that always causes me discomfort is the one about identity. How you should dis identify or notice thoughts of “I feel” “my emotions” etc. I mean this has really fucked with me but has also done wonders when there are periods of crisis in my life or the worrier is out and I can step back, it’s not all bad. I guess overall it has just leveled out the highs and lows, almost like being on an anti depressant. The mind learns to stop itself or be aware of when it’s running away in a an unpleasant way(mindfulness likes to use this word instead of negative) but also when in a pleasant experience. Even sex can be affected if you’re aware of “oh that feels good” and it’s like wait wtf do I even want any of this or is the mind getting its way. 


Things get bad when I’m Feeling happy then notice thought of “I’m happy” and it takes me out of moment because it’s like oh that’s just a thought, do I just feel happy because I’m unconsciously saying I’m happy to myself? I guess that’s worry following the awareness. But I like that type of awareness when it involves thoughts that are unpleasant. I’d like to have it both ways. Awareness and allow the emotions to continue if I want them, and awareness and the ability to be more selective of thoughts I don’t want to engage with. But then the mind can tell itself the desire to want something is just a thought to so what do I actually want? Then I start getting worried that this much mindfulness has been bad for me.

Overall I’m grateful for how mindfulness has become a great tool to understand and step back from thoughts and I would never wish to have not begun this journey. But maybe I’m starting to get lost because I have no where to bounce these ideas off of. I want to still have an identity in addition to this type of awareness that I use to become a better person and be more present.

Another issue for me is that If you start disidentifying with the negative thoughts it’s only natural to do it with the positive thoughts too. It doesn’t cut one way. Sometimes when the kind is super worked up and lots of negative thoughts are rolling by, I can either swim in awareness and just accept that’s how the mind is right now OR I can use CBT to come up with a positive affirmation after investigating but whatever is going on, it just feels like a lot of work. 

Not sure if anyone has any insights. Maybe I should get a mindfulness teacher. I’ve been pulling back from meditation to allow myself to get used to thinking again.

&#x200B;

I have tried to **cancel** my account with headspace for a couple years now and each year during rebill time I am told that my auto-renewal is cancelled, therefore at the end of my paid subscription I should no longer be billed and have access to the platform.  

I received a single email **several months** in advance stating that I would get rebilled in future.  With the sheer volume of emails that the average person gets nowadays its easy for them to get lost. 

&#x200B;

What i'm concerned about is why is this subscription information not available within the app itself??? 

As of today (July 25th, 2023) I am posting below the section ""Account & Subscription""  from the settings page which is the only possible area to communicate subscription or billing information. All other areas are unrelated to that info.

&#x200B;

As you can see the details of when the subscription is up or disabling rebilling, or any pertinent information about the subscription itself is not communicated anywhere here.  

&#x200B;

I was rebilled on a Sunday afternoon when I am unable to speak with a representative (which they make extremely hard) so all I can do is communicate via email and wait.  

&#x200B;

They **refused** to refund me despite contacting them within 24 hours citing their terms and conditions.    The company makes it difficult to reach someone for these types of issues. They make it difficult to cancel your subscription and it has to be done outside of the app when in fact the app is the single place that most users are using the service. Why should I be looking at emails or text messages when this communications should be done within the app itself? The clause is added in their terms because they specifically target users to get away with these types of billing practises. I know this first hand because I knew other companies doing this same practise and were legally forced to change these processes.  

This is very unethical, especially considering Headspace is a service offered within the wellness and mental health community. 

&#x200B;

My advice is **beware of subscribing** with them or end up like me, signing up for a very low yearly price and then being billed at more than double what I originally paid.   


&#x200B;

EDIT: after multiple attempts they finally decided to refund me and I received an email saying I was unsubscribed. This was not an easy process and even if the price becomes extremely attractive in future, this process has tainted me and I can’t risk doing it again.

I had completely stopped meditating for a long while and got back into it because of this event.

So I was an amateur kickboxer. I had a dream 2 years ago that I was going to become a professional fighter. Since then I trained a large amount and had 1 real fight and almost had a second. The reason why I couldn’t have my second fight was because of a concussion I got 4 months ago while I was training. For reference I have had 4 concussions before this most recent one. This concussion caused me to have to cancel my fight and quit the sport forever. I was in absolute shambles. My dream was shattered and there was nothing I could do about it. This concussion I had ended up being my worst concussion yet lasting a full 3 months. If you know anything about concussions it essentially makes it so thinking hard, doing anything strenuous, or using screens causes you pain and worsened your condition. Concussions can also alter your mood making you extremely depressed, anxious, suicidal, and generally irritable. All of this coupled with the fact that I had lost the ability to pursue my passion forever left me wondering what is left in life to do. After about a month of having a concussion my friends/family told me I should start meditating again. I was reluctant but knew it was the right choice. After about a month of mental and physical agony I started meditating 40 mins a day. I started doing the daily meditation and the sadness pack. The sadness pack greatly helped me process my emotions and reframe them in a way that isn’t so problematic. Not only did the meditations help my mental health but they greatly helped me speed up my concussion recovery. I’m doing a lot better now.

My name is Toby, and I have been struggling with anxiety since I was little. Over the years, I've tried various medications and have found that therapy with a psychologist has been most helpful. However, I often struggled with recalling important information during therapy sessions or forgetting crucial details about my experiences since my last appointment.

In response to this challenge, a close friend (whose father experienced a similar problem during his cancer) and I have developed a solution to help improve communication during appointments. Abby is an online chronic symptom journal designed to assist individuals living with chronic illnesses.

Abby allows lets you record your thoughts and feelings in a structured manner then identifies significant themes and trends across multiple journal entries. This valuable information ultimately enables users to better communicate their experiences with healthcare professionals, improving diagnostic and treatment outcomes.

Recognising the potential benefits for those struggling with mental health issues, we have adapted Abby into a user-friendly app that is easily accessible on-the-go. The platform has been tremendously helpful for me during my own  journey, leading to more productive therapy sessions.

Currently, Abby has 50 active users who have found it to be a really helpful tool

It is available at [https://abbyhealth.app](https://abbyhealth.app/) for free if you want to give it a go!

I'm moving along through the basics and I reach pro level 1.  I really like how Andy guides us but I'm really confused about one thing.

What does that mean? I know I'm overthinking it, I know I am. But now that I've overthought it I can't un-think it and so now I have to know what it actually means to rest your mind on the sensation of the breath.

The way Andy says that we should only spend 20 to 30 seconds bringing our attention back to the breath before resting our mind on that sensation made me feel like I've done *all of it wrong*. For sessions 1-8, once I declared my intentions and reasons for doing the exercise, I spent the rest of the session with my attention on my breath because that's what I thought I was supposed to be doing... but apparently I'm supposed to only do that for 20 or 30 seconds and then rest the mind on it? I really just don't understand what it means to rest my mind on my breath.

Am I supposed to just hold the memory of what my breath feels like for 6 minutes or 8 minutes or 10 minutes or however long my session is? Please somebody help, I know I'm overthinking this and I don't know how to not overthink it any further. Thanks in advance.

&#x200B;

I'm new to meditation, and like many of you, I am always busy. Most of my sessions are limited to ten minutes for productivity reasons.

&#x200B;

I've just today finished Basics 1 session 10 instructed by Eve. I CANT STOP MY MIND laser focusing on each new ""step"" of each session. Example: in the first minutes as Eve instructs us to begin by taking a few deep breaths before closing our eyes... Once I've taken those few deep breaths.. then what? I have questions! How do I continue to breathe as we go? Do I continue to keep a concerted effort on my breath as we go along? Am I supposed to forget all about it and let my body breathe on its own? But if I do that then my mind really wanders!  ...  It's a mess! And that's just an example of the first minutes of each session... it often continues like this until near the end of each session when Eve instructs us to begin to count each breath.. THIS is the only part of the sessions where I begin to find a true ""focus"" or non-focus if you will(?)... what I'm trying to say is that during this part is the only time where I truly feel like I'm able to observe my thoughts and let them pass on by as I focus on my breath (but even that feels like its segmented.. this feeling gets broken up with each new breath counted). 

&#x200B;

I normally do ok with the body scan but at times I get frustrated (and sometimes completely restart a session) because I get two or three minutes into a session and I have to MOVE or ITCH my body because as I scan I notice an area of discomfort and then can't stop my mind from focusing on that spot until I physically move or scratch... This seems and feels so WRONG! 

&#x200B;

The last two or three sessions now I feel like they're getting worse because now I'm focused on everything that's interrupting me (im interrupting myself) and the more thought I put on what feels ""wrong"" about each session winds up coming with me to the next..

&#x200B;

I really want to stick with this. Due to my own personal situation... If I can master this skill it would make it so much easier for me to deal with stress and that's something I'm sure that we all share!

This has been building for some time and I feel like I have to get this off my chest or I won't be able to continue to use the app because Andy has become such a huge distraction for me. In fact, I had to break out of today's daily session because these unnecessary and intentional affectations of his has become such a distraction that I couldn't get past it.

Some background first. I am a fully trained clinical hypnotherapist, so I have some familiarity with the patter involved in inducing someone  (or myself) into a different mental state. I have my regular speaking voice and, like all hypnotherapists, I have my ""hypno-voice."" I understand the mechanism here that Andy employs.  Another point: (American) English is my native language and I'd like to think that I have a reasonable command of my mother tongue. Obvious malformations of the language catch my ear.

I have always liked the sound of Andy's voice. I like his accent, usually. But something has changed with him and it's not for the better. It is obvious that there were several different periods when Andy recorded the voice-over bits because there are forms of speech that crop up (all too frequently) now that he didn't express before. Case in point: At the beginning of a session after the prelude bit where he explains some aspect of meditation that has been spliced onto the meditation patter parts. Old Andy would say something like, '... make sure you're SITTING \[emphasis mine\] comfortably..."" This is correct English and the phrasing that Andy USED TO use. New Andy, however, says ""... however you're SAT \[emphasis mine\]...'  This is non-standard English and something Andy DID NOT used to do, such that I am left with the impression that Andy is trying to be one of those ""trendy Brits"" influenced by some unfortunate trend likely started by some ""influencer"" somewhere. Saying ""sat"" instead of ""sitting"" is instantly annoying especially because you didn't used to do it and there's no earthly reason for the change. 

Along with ""sat"" vs ""sitting"" Andy has starting talking too much. WAAAAAAYYY too much during the sessions. And he has added painful, unnecessary pauses so often in his patter that even when you can get past the interruption as just another ambient sound, one is left at the metaphorical edge of one's seat waiting for him to finish the damned sentence, or just the phrase.  Too many times my meditation has been interrupted by my having to mentally shout, ""Andy, STFU!"" Sometimes it feels like ""oh don't forget about me, me, me... listen to me, me, me....""  He didn't used to do this AS MUCH. There have always been too many pauses in his speech but it's gotten worse.

Then there's the repeating himself or rephrasing himself when he's already interrupted the meditation. Adding extra words, rephrasing, whatever. Inserting an instruction or a guided imagery when someone is already induced should be short and to the point. It's not a chance for you to hear the sound of your voice but to give the direction concisely and then STFU.  ""Start scanning down from the top of the body, from the top of the head..."" He used to just say, correctly, ""... from the top of the head..."" Is he paid by the word because the result is not an improvement on the patter but becomes, for some of us, a point of contention that makes using the app an unnecessary stressor when it is supposed to be the exact opposite.

I was doing the Headspace365 but had to give that up because of the constant, incessant, and unnecessary chatter that Andy would add to the session.  The last day I tried H365, in the intro spiel, Andy said words to the effect of ""I'm going to talk a lot less in this session...."" I was ecstatic, but then he made up for it at the end of the session.  I haven't been able to get back to H365 since.

I will continue to try to work past these things that are obvious issues for me, but that are the direct result of a change in the style and substance of Andy's patter.  I highly value Headspace. I just would                  rather not get annoyed using it.

Thanks for reading my rant. I think I feel better now. Maybe I'll try today's daily session again. I had to stop midstream to type this because I'd just had enough. Of course, my annual subscription renewed a couple of weeks ago, so I guess I'm stuck for another year.

I think it must have been around 7-8yrs ago I was last involved with the App. 

I've used quite a few other apps over the years with some I liked more than others. 
After trying Insight Timer recently, I was quickly put off by the volume of content on there from different instructors. So I decided to head back to Headspace.

I like the Today page although I feel it's a little off. It doesn't flow well between days. Key example is one day I had basics day 1, the next day stress course day 1, then the next day back to basics day 2. 
The videos are great though, I do enjoy them. The sleepcasts are even better. I fall asleep within 10-15mins of these so I have no idea what the story is/was.

What I'd love to see though is more comprehensive use of AI. When you login, it asks you how you feel/are/want. From that it would filter to find some recommendations for you or even ask questions back giving it's recommendations but you have another chance to respond to clarify. 

Maybe you are new and you say ""I want a simple meditation for someone new and I'd also like to feel happier this afternoon as I'm a little stressed"". It would ask ""how long do you have, and would you like a video/exercise, etc along with your mediation"".

This is something I wanted to learn for a long time because I believe I'm lacking empathy compared to my peers. Although I understand 'why' they are grieving, I find it difficult to fully understand 'how' they are feeling, most especially to situations I don't relate to. I also don't know how to respond to people who are grieving. The only thing I can do is be a Companion and give them food lol. 

Do we have a course like this in the app? Like an empathy course for feeling what others are feeling?

The closest course that I found is Generosity, with the description ""Train your mind to be less judgemental and critical"". I haven't tried it yet though. There's also the Grieving Course, but I'm not the one who is grieving, just a bystander. Does anyone know other similar courses? Thanks in advance!

I've put my rough recollection of the steps most headspace meditations start with below. I listen mostly to Andy's versions so I'm not sure if the other instructors do things differently. I'm curious if other people here find the intro overwhelming or sort of overbearing sometimes as I do. If so, what have you done when you felt that way? Maybe it's a sign I should do more unguided meditations for a little while?

My recollection of the initial sequence:

1. Sit, ideally with your back upright
2. Have a soft unfocused gaze with eyes open
3. Take deep breaths
4. On an out breath, close your eyes
5. Rest your focus on your physical sensations
6. Then rest it on any sounds you hear
7. Do a body scan
8. During the scan, pay attention to your emotional tone as well as physical sensations
9. Remind yourself of your intention, and if possible incorporate altruism
10. Return your focus to your breath
11. Phew! Now you can finally begin meditating

I think sometimes I'd just prefer something along the lines of:

1. Sit
2. Take a few deeps breaths and close your eyes
3. Focus on your breath and meditate",False,Do others feel that the initial meditation steps can be overwhelming?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Headspace/comments/10lioe8/do_others_feel_that_the_initial_meditation_steps/

I have tried to use many anxiety apps in the past, but always return back to Headspace. I was thinking how cool it would be to have a sort of ""panic button,"" feature on the app?

When I’m laying down to go to bed, it feels like practicing because for the most part, I don’t go along with many of the thoughts that are passing by when trying to fall asleep. It’s more like a thought starts, and before it finishes, i let it go, it is very quickly replaced by another thought and that goes, on and on. It’s hard for me to tell if I’m letting them go or cutting them off though. This is how most of my waking moments are where I’m not working or communicating with others. So when im walking to the bathroom, driving home, running at the park, etc. 

it’s like there is no off mode anymore and sometimes I worry if I would have been better off not starting this journey because the mind is always trying to get to some place of calm, which it thinks thoughts are the enemy of. This causes me a great deal of distress because there are days or moments where the mind is not worried about what is happening with thoughts and feelings and they are just zooming by causing no residual feeling.

The following is the first ever sleepcast written by artificial intelligence...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Intro Paragraph

Welcome to the craggy mountains, a peaceful place for reflection and contemplation. As we stand at the top of the mountain, we are treated to a breathtaking view. The sun is setting behind us, casting a warm, golden light over the city below. The streets are bustling with people making their way home from work, or heading out to enjoy the evening. The buildings are tall and impressive, and the city is alive with the sounds of traffic and people. The sky is painted in shades of pink and orange, and a cool breeze carries the sounds of the city up to us. We are surrounded by towering peaks, and the air is crisp and fresh. We can see for miles in every direction, and the view is simply stunning. It is a peaceful and beautiful sight, and for a moment, all of the worries and cares of the day melt away. Before we explore the peak further, it’s nice to start with a brief wind-down exercise

Paragraph 1- Birds

Up here on the mountain, we are surrounded by the sights and sounds of a variety of birds. The trees around us are filled with the cheerful chirping of finches, with their brightly colored feathers and distinctive songs. We might even see a beautiful goldfinch, with its bright yellow and black markings. In the underbrush, we can hear the lively songs of robins, as they hop from branch to branch in search of insects to eat. The robins have a distinctive reddish-orange breast, and their clear, cheerful songs are a joy to hear. The sky is alive with the graceful flight of hawks and eagles, as they soar on the thermals above the peaks. We might even catch a glimpse of a majestic bald eagle, with its distinctive white head and tail. The air is filled with the fluttering of wings, and the birds seem to be enjoying the peacefulness of the mountain top as much as we are. The other hikers on the mountain are also taking in the sights and sounds of the birds, and the atmosphere is one of peaceful enjoyment. It is a truly magical experience.

Paragraph 2- Deer

There is a truly amazing amount of wildlife on the mountain. As we stand here, enjoying the peacefulness of the evening, we suddenly catch sight of a beautiful deer. It appears out of the brush, and stands at the edge of a clearing, its large, dark eyes fixed on us. We are struck by its grace and elegance, and for a moment, we are frozen in place, simply admiring its beauty. The deer's fur is a rich, reddish-brown color, and it is covered in white spots. Its delicate face is framed by large, sensitive ears, and its long, slender legs are perfectly adapted for life in the mountains. The deer seems equally curious about us, and it takes a few tentative steps closer, its delicate hooves making no sound on the soft grass. We hold our breath, not wanting to frighten it away, and after a moment, the deer turns and bounds back into the brush, disappearing from view. It is a fleeting encounter, but one that we will not soon forget.

Paragraph 3- Sunset

As we stand at the top of the mountain, we are treated to a breathtaking view of the sunset. The sky is painted in vibrant shades of orange, pink, and purple, as the sun sinks slowly below the horizon. The clouds are tinged with gold, and the light of the setting sun reflects off of the surface of the nearby lake. The city below is alive with twinkling lights, as the hustle and bustle of the day gives way to the tranquility of the evening. The mountain stands tall and majestic, casting a long shadow over the landscape. The air is crisp and cool, and the sounds of the city are carried up to us on the breeze. It is a peaceful and beautiful sight, and we stand in awe, watching as the sun sinks below the horizon and the stars begin to twinkle in the night sky.

Paragraph 4- Lake

If you look up towards the peaks of the mountain, you can see the outline of a nearby lake. The water is a deep, crystal-clear blue, and it reflects the vibrant colors of the sunset. The lake is home to a variety of fish, including rainbow trout, bass, and perch. We can see their silver scales glinting in the sunlight as they swim near the surface. The shore is lined with tall, stately pines, and the branches of the trees are reflected in the calm waters of the lake. The mountain peaks rise up around us, and the air is crisp and fresh. We can hear the gentle lapping of the waves against the shore, and the calls of birds as they fly overhead. On the edge of the lake, we can see a small fishing dock, with a few boats moored to it. The dock is weathered and worn, but it still stands strong, a testament to the hardiness of the people who live in this beautiful place. The lake is a truly peaceful and serene spot, and we stand for a moment, simply taking in the beauty of the scene. It is a magical and unforgettable experience.

Paragraph 5- Stars

The night is clear and cloudless, and the sky is filled with twinkling stars. The air is clear and crisp, and the stars seem to be shining more brightly than usual. We can see the constellation of Orion, with its distinctive hourglass shape, and the bright star Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. The Orion Nebula, a cloud of gas and dust where new stars are born, is visible in the constellation of Orion, glowing brightly with a reddish-pink color. The life cycle of a star begins in a nebula like this one, where it forms from a cloud of gas and dust. As the star grows and matures, it will undergo various stages, eventually becoming a red giant and then a white dwarf before it is finally extinguished. The Milky Way stretches across the sky like a glowing band, and we can see countless other stars, too numerous to count. It is a truly breathtaking sight, and we stand in awe, marveling at the beauty and majesty of the starry night sky and the incredible processes that give rise to these fascinating celestial bodies. It is a calming reminder of the impermanence of everything in our daily lives.

Paragraph 6- City

Looking over the high ledge of the mountain, we can see the city stretched out below us. The city is a bustling metropolis, with tall skyscrapers and bustling streets. The lights of the city are a dazzling sight, and we can see cars moving along the highways, their headlights and taillights creating streaks of light. One building in particular catches our eye, a towering high-rise with floor-to-ceiling windows that glint in the light. The building is a beacon of modernity and success, and we can't help but feel a sense of awe at its grandeur. The city is alive with the sounds of people going about their day, and we can hear the distant hum of traffic and the chatter of people on the streets. The city is a vibrant and exciting place, full of energy and opportunity. It is a contrast to the peacefulness of the mountain, and we stand for a moment, taking in the sights and sounds of the city before us. It is a fascinating and unforgettable view.

Paragraph 7- Peak

We turn around, looking up to the top of the mighty mountain. We catch sight of the peak of the mountain, covered in snow. The snow is a pristine white, and it sparkles in the sunlight. While the peak of the mountain is covered in a thick layer of snow, but the area around us is free of snow. We can see the tracks of animals that have passed through the area, and the ground beneath our feet is rocky and rough. The snow on the peak is a testament to the harshness of the mountain environment, and we are reminded of the power and majesty of nature. It is a truly awe-inspiring sight, and we stand for a moment, taking in the beauty of the snowy peak.

Paragraph 8- Placard

You look over to see a placard near the edge of the lookout area. The placard offers a detailed and fascinating description of the mountain and its surroundings. It features a beautiful map of the area, highlighting the peak of the mountain and the various winding trails and exotic landmarks in the surrounding area. For the more scientifically-minded, the map also shows the different elevations and features of the mountain, providing a visual representation of its size and scale. The placard also provides information about the mountain's geological history and its unique features, such as its rocky cliffs and dramatic waterfalls. It includes details about the different types of flora and fauna that can be found on the mountain, from towering trees to colorful wildflowers and rare species of birds and animals. The placard even features conservation efforts that are in place to protect the mountain and its natural environment. As visitors read the placard and learn more about the mountain, they can better appreciate its beauty and significance, and feel a sense of complete peace and calm in this special place.

&#x200B;

P.S. For those who wish to try this themselves, go to chat/openai.com/chat. Then, all you have to do is give it a basic prompt (I.E write a calming description of an encounter with a deer at the top of the mountain). It will write a paragraph. Then, you can clarify (I.E revise the paragraph to include a description of the deer's markings) and it makes revisions for you.

Voice control support was recently removed due to Google sunsetting (retiring) Conversational Actions. This change was made to focus on App Actions, which is a different service from Google which aims at making voice control for third party apps easier to integrate for third party devs such as Headspace.  


As such, I kinda expected Headspace to have some intent to integrate App Actions voice control into their app as many have expressed their love for this feature. I contacted Headspace support and was told there are no current plans for re-adding voice control. I hope they change their mind on this matter. I could be misunderstanding some of this but Google still supports Conversational Actions until sometime next year to allow third party apps to prepare for a transition to App Actions.

Either I am the only one who cannot do this or the instructions are not clear - but if they were not, how come is body scan describer everywhere in the app the same, and even be there a scanning animation? Also, since in  some meditations Andy (or whoever I guess) tells you to first generally check your body, and then do the body scan, the body scan cannot be just ""general check in entire picture"". So, how do you guys do this, and how does this makes sense? This is hones question, I just don't get it. Am I the only one unable to do this?

&#x200B;

I had an interesting experience and would like to know if anyone can provide some insight into what happened. It was on day 9 of the mind meditation series in the year in review program. Andy had you ask in the third person ""How would you feel if you knew, today were (was? I can't remember the exact phrasing) your last; how would you feel?"" After you ask you simply observe and see what arises. Interesting times! I began to become more appreciative of my immediate friends. I had happy elated times, and sad times.. some of which involved me tearfully petting my dog because our time would eventually come to an end (he's only a year old lab, still plenty of life). 

Now that the stage is set here is how the session went...

&#x200B;

I sat down in my chair and did a satisfying body scan and settled into relaxing my back and shoulders, usual areas of resistance for me. I began focusing on my breath in the usual manner, watching them go in and out till I could just ride the breath. Then it was time for the question, I had felt what felt like a very deep state of meditation, my thoughts were very slow to come through, and just sitting was becoming the majority of the action in my mind. Then suddenly I had the feeling of falling backward or downward, or as if I had suddenly dropped down through a hole. Similar to the random falling feeling one can get when they are falling asleep at times. This feeling was both thrilling and slightly scary in a roller coaster kind of way. In the sessions leading up to this, you would imagine a feather falling onto the feeling or thought that rose, and without thinking I had the feather being applied to the feeling.

&#x200B;

I had some lingering feelings of lightness and very mildly happy euphoria. It also felt like something had died in a way, some feeling of anxiety or something I had been stuck with. I can't even pinpoint what exactly but I am glad to be rid of it. 

&#x200B;

I would like to hear if anyone had similar experiences, or if what I experienced was some form of delusion.

whenever I'm doing a meditation, doesn't matter if it's the meditation provided on the start screen or if I'm doing something out of e. g. the stress course: it seems like you're always doing the same few things like body scan, noting, focussing on the breath and some more.

I am sure there was a walking mediation where you are supposed to first focus on 5 things you can see, then some things you can hear, then things you can touch/feel. I think it was a female voice, too.

It is not:
Walking in nature
Walking in the city

On 02/27/22, I (25F) broke my ankle in three places. Due to this injury, I have fallen into a pretty deep depression. Long before I broke my ankle, I was diagnosed with Bipolar type II. I’m on a few psychiatric medications, and I’ve been in therapy since I was 10. (Mostly CBT and DBT)

I’ve always struggled with mindfulness and being present. My traumatized brain struggles with intrusive thoughts, violent or humiliating images from my past tend to get triggered by pretty benign things. 

With this being said, I told the doctor’s office that I started therapy again due to this new onset of depression because of my injury. They told me they could prescribe me six months of an app called Headspace at no cost, which I had never heard of.

I’ve been using it for seven days and I feel a lot clearer headed, less heavy behind the eyes. I feel more in tune with my body and my emotions. My thoughts typically never stop racing, I have an internal monologue that doesn’t cease. Doing the meditation has been INVALUABLE to my emotional regulation. I usually let my thoughts consume me, but this app has enabled me to kind of just acknowledge them without needing to linger on them for minutes or hours or days. 

If you’re thinking about paying for it, maybe just do one month to see how it feels for you. What I will say is that I do have to work at it. It’s work, especially for somebody that struggles with being presently here. My head is always somewhere else.

After research/experience, I learned how to reconnect my whole spiritual body to be able to feel it's energy on every one of my limbs and I gained the capacity to maintain it for hours with highly noticeable residual effects lasting that whole day.

We all can easily access and get a grip on this spiritual energy. When it activates on its own, it comes with goosebumps and this is a blessing in disguise to help you gain control, direct and enhance your energy.

How? 

Because Goosebumps also* activate from positive situations/stimulis (like memories, inspirations, music, love, gratitude, meditation) a euphoric surge of flowing energy, that can be observed as a hot or cold wave flowing underneath your skin. 

It's a blessing in disguise because it gives you the opportunity to analyze it to consciously bring it back up with a ""healing/blissful/feel good"" touch to it. 

And that is your spiritual energy.

A lot of entries on that page are basically an organized version of many feature requests posted to this sub in the past.

If enough people vote/post on the FeatureAsk page, I'll reach out to Jeff inviting him to check the page out and see if he's open to regularly monitoring it to be constantly updated of the voice of the community.

I think my biggest issue with it is time. It's roughly a 20-40 minute commitment depending on how long you make the 2 meditations. And is it worth shortening a meditation to make more time for The Wake Up video if I want to keep the routine to a certain length?

I think the second thing that I'm curious about is the sense of redundancy of it. The meditations start off with deep breaths, so the initial breathing exercise feels redundant in that way. And the fact that you do a daily meditation followed by a course meditation also feels pretty redundant, not to mention if the topics are unrelated it feels like it could be a lot to take in. Is this redundancy intentional or was this more of a somewhat careless design choice along the lines of, ""well we want to have some sense of progression so let's just do it like this and users can just choose to skip the parts they don't want to do""? I just want to know if I'm missing out on something by not doing the whole routine!

I'm curious to hear your experience of the morning routine!

It's all energetic. More importantly when you can easily activate your energetic (spiritual) body you have the opportunity to simply lead that blockage of energy elsewhere and to simply come back to a state of balance.

It is proven that diseases occur when negative emotions (energy in motion) are trapped in specific locations of a physical body. 

Actions, reactions, thoughts and desires all cause specific areas in physical bodies to ""activate"" with energy.
(undeniable example: grief)
""activation"" can be explained as energy (hot or cold) condensing/emitting in high amounts.

States of high vitality occurs when every single one of your limbs (Not just your stomach, or your hands. All of your body.) is flowing with your energy.

A blessing in disguise to help you direct and enhance your energy are Goosebumps.

Why? 

Because Goosebumps also* activate from positive situations/stimulis (like memories, inspiration, music, love, gratitude, meditation) a blissful surge of flowing energy that can be observed as a hot or cold wave underneath your skin.

This is the same energy that activates areas on physical bodies.

When activated through goosebumps you get to understand how to do so with a ""healing/blissful/feel good"" touch to it. 
That is your spiritual energy.
It comes from your Spiritual (energetic) Body/ your Mind/Consciousness/Awareness.

Many meditation apps offer a space where users can escape into, such as Calm or Headspace. I find it important that I have them because sometimes I need a break. It feels like those apps rock me like a baby.   


But what I missed in my life and what I really believe in is that we need meditation apps that are a bit more direct, like a wise old teacher. It seems to me that many meditation apps try to make the user's stay as comfy as possible to keep them happy customers.  


So, three years ago I dived into app development, gathered a team and started working on the meditation and awareness app ORRO. This one has an important message: ""Don't avoid the storm. Go into it. Because every time you go you transform yourself and the world around you.  


Now, after having done my first PALINDROME RELEASE on the 22 02 2022. As expected the so far user feedback now teaches me again the truth about what people think meditation is: An escape. They are expecting that ORRO would rock them like babies but no... ORRO only offers meditation stories like ""the levitating rock"".   


I think it will be very hard to teach people that meditation is about accepting whatever is present. Because this is exactly the opposite of escapism. You know?

In these times, it's very sad to me but meditating no longer feels like a safe place to go to. In fact, when I meditate I find myself ruminating even harder on the things I'm anxious about, especially when I close my eyes. And trying to move my focus back to my breath doesn't seem to help because my breath feels so small in comparison to the noise in my head. It's like trying to pay attention to a whisper in the middle of a rock concert. It just kind of gets ""drowned out"". If I count my breaths I will literally have like 3 thoughts in between each number I count because my mind is just racing so hard. It seems like it just leaves too much space for the rumination to continue.

I'm wondering if in times of intense anxiety like this, are there techniques I can use to make the object of focus stand out more? Some ideas I had were to try speaking a mantra word or tone out loud, or breathing in a way that is more audible, or using a guided meditation instead of one with more silence so the speaker's voice can bring me back.

Maybe I'd be better off doing something physical like going for a walk in nature or doing some hobby that takes my mind off of things?

Here's a bit about my journey but also a description of what persists from when I started to where I am now. I am hoping more experienced users of the platform can offer some guidance.

Prior to making meditation part of my daily routine, I was in a pretty hazy space. On a whim I left my life in NY and took advantage of an opportunity to move to CA with family. I say whim but it felt pretty compelled to, I gave it no initial or second thought, even though it came at the cost of leaving behind my GF, my friends, my situation and just starting over. In retrospect it was best for me, I still can't shake maybe I let others down, but it still feels right considering the position I am in now both in a new healthier environment and having a sense of family again. When I made the move I thought had some idea of a plan for myself, but the reality of the move revealed a lot I had put aside regarding myself. Instead of feeling it, I hid behind lots of distractions, lots of YouTube, weed, and in no time realized days, weeks and months past. Most of that time seems like a blur. Connections I had began to drift mostly because I just stopped trying.

Next thing I knew it had been 6 months and I realized I just needed to change and return to things that worked. Realized I had gained excess weight and quickly lost it again in a matter of weeks, I'm mostly an endurance athlete and knew what I needed to do for myself to turn things around again. The reality of excluding everyone around me kept hitting harder and harder and I'm sure I could have done things differently but I just did not know how else to make sense of everything. A few more months past and I just remember coming back from a heavy lifting session, stretching out, smoking a joint and just laying on the ground. This was the first time in a long time I felt mentally free. It was after Andy mentioned toward the end of a session to stop focusing on the breath and let your mind do whatever it wants to, I laid there for an hour although it did not feel like it. (I don't necessarily advocate for meditating high, but I do think it's worth trying once)

Buddhism and Stoicism are philosophies I've followed on-and-off in the years prior but I just felt a push to dive in deeper and got myself a Headspace subscription, I did few guided meditations but did not commit. A few more months past, the pandemic and other events followed and I was more or less in the same space but with some direction on improving myself. During this time I enrolled into a Master's program and truly felt some direction again. The future I had imagine for myself became more clear and the reliance on my vices became less of a necessity. I realized I began to maintain a streak of 30 days and it just kept going up as I allowed myself to sit with myself. In undergrad I had an idea of what I wanted to do with my career but I focused too much on research, my NGO work, training, all really distracting myself from the work I actually needed to do. I'm not sure if it was about not truy doing what I want or just wanting to explore other things before commiting to my career of choice (I'm a 27M btw)

Maybe about 5 months in I began to realize maybe I was just too much in my head, or realized I was tuning out the wrong voices. I'm still not sure. I just know that before I need to start my day, I need the time to sit with myself. For days where there is conflict, I do not react immediately sometimes at all -- which completely counters how I would have being home in NY in my old life. I sit with the feeling, cry, be angry, fall asleep, but that it all, the feeling passes, I let the moment go sometimes at the fault of the situation and not something I need to internalize.

At some point I stopped running through courses and embraced the daily meditations, I think the its randomness adds some novelty. But, even now typing this out I feel either I'm missing something, or that I should be doing more, not sure if I should be doing something more with the practice? I lurked the Buddhism subreddit, not sure if choosing a flavor of Buddhism would help or maybe I should do more longer meditation sessions (usually average around 20 minutes) - but part of me also makes sense of this confusion by just acknowledging the volume and intensity of what I'm feeling now as being less consuming.

Sat on this for sometime, part of it is ranty other parts I'm hoping more senior practitioners can give some light on.

If I could give some advice, being an endurance athlete, I often chase the status of the streaks. But, it'll come. Just establish a healthy relationship with the practice that suits where you are now and the streak will naturally come. There are days where I know what I need to do in the day and meditate to clear my mind/let my mind go wild.

One part that I didn't like while listening to the power of now was the concept of how our pain-body can be stopped in our body before it reaches and contaminates the mind... Well, when I tried to do that and stop the ""sickness of negativity"" as he calls it, it didn't work out and I became extremely anxious because I was trying to use his technique to stop the pollution by being conscious and then letting the unconscious mind (anxiety) dissipate as he says ""it cannot withstand the power of the conscious mind"". Also love, joy, and all those emotions are created from our minds. From oxytocin, dopamine, and serotonin receptors. How can he say that love is the only thing that's left when you have ""no thoughts"" when it is precisely the mind which creates these emotions??

Now I liked a lot of other things he talked about as well and I use what he talks about and they relate to most things that Andy Puddicumbe from HeadSpace teaches. I like how in Headspace Andy teaches us to view anxiety as a storm that you observe through a window and he wants us to take a step back and not try to force anything. And you note your thinking/feeling (like how Tolle talks about it) and gently bring yourself back to the present moment. And Andy also teaches us to change our relationship with anxiety and become friends with it. That is from his Managing Anxiety course and it has helped me A TON. Also, the blue sky technique and mentality are very similar to Tolle's talk of our innate state being of love and joy and it's just covered by clouds of thoughts sometimes but beneath all the clouds the clear blue sky is always there. The blue sky technique helped me out as well.

But yeah I don't think that the power of now was very useful to me. There were some pieces of knowledge but overall it's strange imo. 

Here are links to some articles that I read the first few paragraphs of and I agree with them. The titles sound aggressive but they aren't attackey types of articles.

In this article, I don't like his focus on spirituality as much as I am not a very religious person anymore (agnostic).

&#x200B;

Hey lovely folks in this hivemind,

I'm looking for certain meditations on Headspace or elsewhere and am wondering if you could help.

So, I have a little history of emotional neglect. Thus I sometimes fall into patterns where I invalidate my feelings and/or feel guilty, bad or weak for having them. I'm great at hiding, dissociating and distracting. But I'd like to practice and learn how to break out of those invalidation patterns and be able to sit with my feelings once again. At the moment, I have a really hard time to step out of it or to soothe myself. (Yes, I'm already in therapy).

I'd like to try meditating when I'm in those moods and see whether it helps. But I have noticed is that when I'm those moods, I cannot pick up Headspace. As being told to step away from my feelings, or that my stress and tension simply dissolves, etc. would trigger this emotional invalidation. 

I think that a meditation that explicitly addresses feelings of distress could be helpful. I'd need something that doesn't immediately prompt me to focus on something else like my breath, but rather holds a little more space for sitting with the emotion. Maybe a meditation where the guide says some comforting words about my current distress.

It's easier to drop the filter than to raise it, so I usually sit through the meditation with the ringing sound. I choose to think of it as part of my mind that helps me to meditate. I used to think that I *suffered* tinnitus, but now I just experience it. The ability to choose how I experience it is very powerful.

I guess my issue is, when I'm instructed to think on something (like breadth), I would have a lot of free thoughts coming by; but when I'm instructed to think freely, I need to purposely find some thoughts , and suddenly I don't know what I should think about.

So again with the OCD, I climbed up a nearby peak to see if I could get enough cell phone signal to load it.

I have Headspace linked to my Google Home and I'm trying to set it up so I can play a Sleepcast (a person talking for 45 min) as I fall asleep and then Sleep radio (8 hours of sound) while I am sleeping. 

I can't seem to find a way to set this up that doesn't require input from me. I'd like to do this from my Google Home so I can continue to leave my phone in the other room while I sleep, but if I could create this setup from my phone I wouldn't mind.

The way it's working currently is:

1. I trigger my nighttime routine on the Google Home.
2. Headspace asks me to confirm if I want to continue a Sleepcast or get a new one.
3. Sleepcast plays.
4. I have a 45 min delay and then Sleep Radio should start.
5. Headspace asks if I want to try a sleep cast, do a sleep exercise or listen to soothing music. I choose soothing music but it only plays for about 45 min. 

The 5th step seems to be where things are going wrong. I don't want to do an input, as I hope to be asleep by this point, but I also can't figure out how to get the 8 hours of music to play v 45 min.

During meditation, every single time you activate your spiritual energy and then become aware/put all your attention on it, its enough to take you deeper into meditative states until you reach the deepest stage of meditation.

I call this energy ""Spiritual chills"". 
It goes by many different names like Euphoria, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Mana, Frisson, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, The Force and many more.

And it can be noticed whenever you get goosebumps from positive events.

Focusing on it untill it dissipates then re activating it with each new breath, during your meditation, eventually will even lead you into a real state of full body bliss, joy or tranquility.

The term spiritual energy isn't loosely used here.
This is not to be underestimated.

When you're feeling bad and you're thinking about what you don't want, you fill these pathways with negative energy so dense that overtime blocks them.

Science Now shows that this actually occurs. 

So there is a simple technique that allows you to clear up these pathways in virtually a minute or two(Depending on how aware and experienced you are of your energetic body).

When you successfully do so, you become able to again feel euphoria all over your body and for long durations, with your conscious movement of your spiritual energy that comes directly from your true self(your Spirit).

I call this energy ""Spiritual chills"". 
It goes by many different names like Euphoria, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Mana, Frisson, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, The Force and many more.

Your spiritual body also has senses that you kinda had to put to the side to fully use your  physical body. 
Senses of a psychic nature and since we own this spiritual body, they are and have always been at our disposal.
Controlling your spiritual chills with knowledge of ir is the key to use those senses.

Here's a simple and short[Tutorial video](https://youtu.be/_VUnuM82qd4) to help clear your meridians.

I thought about taking this perspective and applying it to Andy’s managing anxiety noting technique. We are taking an action by noting whether it’s thinking or feeling then labelling it and bringing ourselves back to the present moment.

So the question now becomes if we are habitually ignoring what our anxiety/negative emotions are telling us then aren’t we losing out on gaining valuable feedback? I feel as if we are not solving our problems but rather ignoring our bodies innate alarm/warning signal. I think you have to get actively involved with thinking rather than just “observing it” because then you aren’t making any solid plans to overcome problems in your life.

I agree with Andy that anxiety isn’t the issue but rather just getting caught up in it and going down and negative spiral causes us to implode. Getting mad at ourselves and worrying about getting anxious which makes us more anxious into. And Andy’s technique has helped me a lot. Because I take out the time during the end of the day to mindfully journal and come up with solutions to problems then, so I am actively engaging with solving problems. But wouldn’t it be more productive to solve them as my body gives me the signal that something is wrong and we have to fix it (a.k.a. anxiety giving us energy and telling us something isn’t right so we go fix it (e.g. we left the oven on and we go turn it off therefore preventing the house from burning down))? come up? Although I do notice myself getting into the habit of worrying and feeling as if I’m doing something but in reality I’m not solving anything. At other times I make solid plans that help me in solving problems.

If you look at a light coming from a light bulb through microscopes and even finer ways to observe it, you will see real particle flow.

If you took that exact same light and did not increase the wattage, did not increase anything but just focused the light, you could virtually create a laser beam from that.

The room would be dark and there'd be a beam of light that would go straight down and could potentially start a fire in the rug or even put a hole in the floor. Same amount of energy, same amount of light. The only difference is it was focused. 

The point is.

You have particles flowing from your being. This happens when you get goosebumps. 
How? During that physical reaction there's also a gas-like energy moving underneath your skin.

(This energy can be summoned, manipulated and focused without goosebumps but recognizing it there first is a great start to it's conscious control.)

I call this energy ""Spiritual chills"". It goes by many different names like Euphoria, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, The Force and many more.

This wonderful gas-like movement inside of you is your Spiritual energy. Directly from your true self (soul, spirit). It easily leaves your body and becomes an auric field.

Your spiritual body also has senses that you kinda had to put to the side to fully use your  physical body. Senses of a psychic nature. We also own a spiritual body so They are at our reach.
Controlling your spiritual chills with knowledge of it is the key to use them.

I was manipulative, emotionally abusive, I blackmailed her. I was a REAL nasty piece of work, if I'd been her, I'd have left too, fuck the guy I used to be!

So, I reached out to a doctor for help, i finally realised how bad my mental health was. She suggested a few apps, and one had 3 free meditation exercises. Id never even thought aabout meditation before, let alone actually done it, but I did the 3 exercise quickly but was disappointed that 99% of the features of this app was behind a paywall, and I was only interested in the meditation at this point.

So, I looked on the play store, just searched 'meditation', and Headspace was there, so i took a chance and downloaded it. 

From the very first basics session, I felt SO at ease with Andy guiding me, and after my first meditation with the Headspace app i cried. It unlocked all these emotions and feelings I didnt know I had. I could see what I needed to do to continue improving myself and not be the cunt she had left.

This was six weeks ago, and I just reached over 1000 minutes meditation and I am SO pumped. The best purchase I've made in a very long time is the years subscription to this app.

Meditation through Headspace has made me calmer, more relaxed, more focused on the task at hand of improving myself, and without hyperbole, has helped me become a much better person, and finally, after a long time, I am actually happy with who I am. Obviously I'm sad that it took her leaving for me to make the changes I needed to make, but Headspace makes things easier, and keeps me on track when I get too into my own head.

Although when manipulating my spiritual energy and activating my spiritual body to the point where my awareness was more on it than my physical body, I saw myself glow, not only that but everything in the room I was in was glowing!

When you hear about bioluminescence, your mind probably jumps to deep-sea creatures like the angler fish, which uses millions of bacteria to make a light appear in front of its head to catch prey and illuminate your nightmares. But what about humans?

A team of Japanese scientists studied this in 2009 and found that participants 'glowed' throughout the day, with the brightest spots appearing around the forehead, neck, and cheeks in the late afternoon. The dimmest bioluminescence was recorded late at night.

The spiritual energy I was manipulating that night is called ""Spiritual chills"" (energy under your goosebumps which can be summoned without goosebumps but recognizing it there first is a great start to it's conscious control) which goes by many different names like Euphoria, Voluntary Piloerection, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Goosebumps, The Force and many more.

If you would like to know which technique I was using with it to experience this, heres a short [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/_VUnuM82qd4) explaining what I was doing during this occurrence.

For example, smells. Animals in the wild, many of them have very sensitive, highly developed senses of smell. Many animals have a sense of smell that goes beyond human comprehension. Scientists know that there are smells that are not picked up by any device. Pheromones is one of these all human beings emit a fragrance called pheromones and if you don't know it's a sexual attractant smell. It's also in the wild. 

However, you can't detect it with your nose. But on a subconscious level, your body does and chemically reacts to this. So these things that our eyes cannot pick up do exist. Especially spiritual energy.

Number one. These are things for you to consider by the way. You don't have to 100% believe it, for different reasons. That's perfectly, okay. You don't have to believe and I say you don't have to 100% concur with anything I say just consider it as an opinion. Some of you this will resonate with and say: this answers many of my questions now I get it. But it doesn't matter. You can still get the benefits from this material, whether you 100% believe this or not.

Number two should you try to understand completely? Not necessarily. Think about when you get a brand new car. Do you understand how the combustion engine works? Do you understand how the ignition works? Maybe you have a general idea, but do you really know how it all works? No, but do you still drive your car and get the benefits of your car? Yes.

Science can't completely explain many of these spiritual occurences reported around the world but it's there and it's real. If you understand that the possibility of what I'm talking about is real, that will help you. You don't have to believe everything I say, but you could say that's a possibility. 

Since our birth, how we normally and automatically use this energy is hidden from us. Eventually we get a preview of it. Unfortunately, since we are not taught how to recognize it, we don't even know what is happening.

Now I want you to think about how a simple thought can give you goosebumps all over your body. Your whole physiology will change for a couple of seconds even minutes by raising the hair all over your body thanks to a simple thought!

After 9 years of study and experience I've discovered over 10+ mind-blowing spiritual abilities that can be activated with your spiritual energy. Many of these abilities are out there already but they all miss this crucial ingredient to be constant with them and consciously control them.

I call this energy ""Spiritual chills"" (energy under your goosebumps which can be summoned with any goosebumps but recognizing it there first is a great start.) which goes by many different names like Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Goosebumps, The Force and many more.

I want to keep my streak as meditation in general helps me be more calm & kind to others, I'm just afraid before starting individual meditations.

Because he actively spreads health misinformation, but you can spend a few grand on a consultation, supplements, and a meal plan from him.

I am sure this has been asked, however, I searched google and this subreddit and didnt really find what I was looking for.

When I 1st started the app the Today tab presented me with some items - Mindful Activity, The Wake up, Today's Meditation then an Afternoon Lift for a workout and an At Night sleepcast.  The afternoon lift and sleepcast part I will likely ignore for now as my afternoon lift so to speak is done via Apple Fitness+ and my sleep routine is pretty good - 30 min of one of my books and I am out.

As for the rest, it seemed to make perfect sense to me and I like it.  A quick mindful activity followed by a little wake up inspiration.  Then I did the daily meditation around lunch.

It started getting confusing when I went and looked at the courses. I found one named ""basic"" and did session 1.  It seemed like a good choice for a new person. Now, today, the ""Today"" shows all that I mentioned plus the course.  

I guess my questions are  
Do you do both, the course and daily meditation, or can the course take over as your daily meditation?

Can you do multiple sessions of your course in one day or should you only do 1?

I started multiple courses but it only shows the latest one I did in ""Today"". I assume this is because it only suggest you do 1 at a time?

Normally when meditating I go into a sort of trance that's barely on the cusp of sleep. Today though I was much more alert, and just, resting my mind.


A mental map of my mind came into view. There's a sort of, platform, inside my head. It's flat but behind it, it falls down into a dark tunnel that eventually leads to sleep. Throughout the day, my mind is actively floating above my head, extremely busy making connections, thoughts, ideas, analyzing the past, trying it's darndest to predict the future and plan for it.


When I sleep, it just slowly moves down into this trance tunnel, until eventually I fall asleep.


So, when I would meditate it was basically a balance between these things. It would calm it down till it was in this trance tunnel. Some days my mind was floating just above falling asleep. On these days I would often still have thoughts, they were just extremely muted, deep, and I had less control, similar to a dream. Other days my mind would go deeper and I would basically just fall asleep.


Today though was different. Today my mind rested on that platform in my head. Just chilled there. Maybe the first time really feeling at rest. I was extremely alert, unlike past meditations, almost like I was looking at my body from the inside. An inside-of-body experience. And it was much easier for me to manage my thoughts. It was really interesting.

I got to that place by focusing in my breathe and my body and sitting up instead of laying down or being reclined.

I am a student and musician and began my Headspace journey back in October 2020. I am in a part of Europe where the lockdowns that began in late fall and lasted until spring, were absolutely brutal. My daily meditation practice was one of the only things that helped me stay somewhat mentally healthy. Going through some of the courses gave my days structure and kept my general level of anxiety and stress surrounding the pandemic in check. I am so grateful to Headspace for helping me get through a really long and really harsh winter. 

Now, everything has completely flipped. “Regular” life is beginning again, which means social gatherings and gigs, for which I am incredibly grateful for, but now there is no predictability. I am running from one thing to the next, getting spontaneous calls for gigs or get togethers while my to-do list only seems to grow. I have stopped my daily meditation because I feel like I don’t have time and while this is everything I missed back in the lockdown, now I have no idea how to keep my stress in check. I’m stressed even to plan something even one day in advance in the event I have to cancel because of a sudden work opportunity. Like in the lockdown, there is a lack of structure, only now due to the chaos and unpredictability of “regular” life, instead of just wide empty days. I should say that of course, I am unbelievably grateful to be getting some work right now, especially as a freelance musician, it just also comes with some other kinds of stress. I know, deep in my heart, that getting my meditation going again will help all of this, I just do not know where to begin getting it to be a regular practice once again. 

I would be so, so grateful for any tips to help me get my practice going again to help me through this different kind of stress.

I've been using Headspace for a few years now, and when my subscription was expiring in January of this year, I was feeling like Headspace was a bit...stale. I had done most of the structured packs -- at least the ones that interested me, and I felt like every time I opened the app I was having trouble finding a meditation that was pertinent to my current mood that I hadn't already tried a few times before.

I know a lot of folks will say you don't need an app and I get that, but for me, I like the having a roadmap of meditations laid out for me, and I like going back to a familiar voice. It helps keep me on track.

Anyway, I settled on the Calm app and not only have the same issues resurfaced where I can't seem to find a meditation, I just can't get into it. I thought I wanted an app where I could open it and go in a thousand directions but that's not the case. I find I'm overwhelmed with all their options, and once you do a meditation it may or may not ""bookmark"" your spot, so the next day when you log back in you're starting from scratch again.

I also really didn't like any of their narrators voices or ways of doing things. I found myself drifting off a lot while looking back on my days with Andy and Headspace where I would lock in and forget the world around me for 20 minutes. That never happened using Calm.

I'm not saying Headspace is better. I'm saying it's better FOR ME. Everyone is different and everyone's needs are different, but sometimes when you're feeling restless a complete shakeup isn't necessary.

I appreciate what Headspace offers me and I will continue to explore their sections on focus and sleep. I'm happy to be back.",False,Back on Headspace - How I've Missed it,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/Headspace/comments/o9qclf/back_on_headspace_how_ive_missed_it/

I listen to the Everyday/Today’s Headspace meditation and some gems that Andy drops just resonate with me on such a deep level. His point of view and way of reframing things I find very powerful.

This started with the recent success at my job and becoming a father (about to have another one in August, yay!) I’m also looking to work on my communication due to recent feedback (professionally and personal) that it can come off more aggressive than I would like. 

It’s time that I start talking to a therapist. I have seen some in the past but I need one to challenge me in a productive way. I would really like someone to have background in Mindfulness, Meditation or Buddhism to help guide me. Therapist that I have seen in the past have mindfulness based practices but no one with the depth that I’m looking for similar to Andy’s.

I’m going to look locally in the Denver area (through psychology-today) but thought I would throw it out in the Reddit world to see if anyone has suggestions or referrals since we can do anything remotely nowadays. Male only therapist please. Thanks for reading and for any help that is offered!

The running theme in Headspace is to be mindful of our thoughts and emotions and to observe them from a distance. On **Day 3 of Part 3 in the Managing Anxiety course, Andy says ""This creates a spacious mind and emotions appear less overwhelming to us""**. And today he said to be aware of how often we tend to over-identify with them. And this makes a lot of sense because not identifying with anxiety is awesome! But what about self-affirmations then? Such as I am a happy person, or I am a genuine and caring person. Even though some are traits isn't being a ""nervous wreck"" also a trait? How can we choose to identify with positive emotions but not our negative ones? 

I know I am overthinking this but my brain has a harder time being able to distance one emotion that we don't want to feel as much as the others. And then be able to embrace the positive happier emotions and choose to identify with those instead.

TLDR; How do you use self-affirmations and identify with positive feelings while distancing yourself from your negative ones? Isn't that a contradiction in and of itself?

I'd been doing Headspace meditation sessions off-and-on for five or six years prior to 2021 -- but this year, I decided to start taking it a bit more seriously. Over the past five months, I've worked my way through the Foundation series and all of Headspace Pro. Yesterday, I got started on the Anxiety pack. The experience has been beyond worthwhile: I can almost *feel* the ways in which my thinking has changed; much more focused, much less impulsive; I find that I have a great deal more control over *where* my mind goes, more control over which emotions I choose to experience (and which ones I choose to let simmer); when I decide to delve into any given emotion, I find that it is a much more rich and rewarding emotional experience than the flatness I had grown used to in my twenties and early thirties.

When I first started dabbling in meditation (as a hoity-toity undergrad), I went into it with a lot of the spiritualist aspirations that tend to lead so many people astray: I wanted nirvana, ASAP. Obviously, this is the wrong attitude to take. But I no longer think of it that way. I meditate because it benefits me and the people around me, and because those benefits are tangible and practical; any zen I pick up along the way is just an added bonus.

... but today, I experienced *something else.* I'd spent the afternoon reading philosophy (Aristotle, of all things); then I popped down to the garage and did some *wing chun* kung fu stuff for an hour or so. When I sat down to meditate, I was especially loose, especially focused -- but in all other respects perfectly normal.

After about ten minutes of meditation, I disappeared. *Shoop.* Gone. Not asleep. But not *there,* either.

Naturally, there is no real way of describing this state of mind. Time meant nothing; I meant nothing; nothing meant anything. All there was was *this*. But it was a blissful sort of *this*.

I'm not here to ask whether what I experienced was nirvana or oneness or anything like that -- these are brain states that vary from person to person and, even if we could identify them, I don't know that we'd be able to properly describe them to each other. But I'm wondering whether any of you lucky folks have experienced something similar.

My only concern (going forward) is that I might *try* to bring about this state again -- I'd be insane if I didn't; it is a very desirable state -- and therefore *try too hard.* Then again, thanks to Headspace, I also suspect that I've developed the necessary strategies to get back there if I'd like to -- and if not, no biggie.

Hope this made sense, and I hope some of y'all can relate!

There are a few things which I'm finding distracting/frustrating/feel I'm not getting what I should be out of it. Wondered if anyone has any thoughts. Hopefully it doesn't come across as being a rant, and if you think the best advice is ""do something else"" feel free to say!

* The question is ""Who or what would you miss the most if you weren't around any more"". Maybe this is a British thing, but that sounds weird - ""if you weren't around anymore"" makes me think someone has died, in which case they won't be missing much!. If it was ""Who or what would you miss the most if **it or they** weren't around anymore"" I would be a lot more on board with it. Am I misreading the question, does my version have the same meaning, or am I missing something?
* This might be because of my issue in the previous point, but I'm not feeling anything noticeable in response to the question (except the first time when it was a mixture of confused/frustrated, but that was due to the semantics of the question, which I don't think is the aim!). Is this normal?
* Andy says to ""let the mind sink down into the feeling"". Does he just mean, accept the feeling is there without judgement? Otherwise I'm not sure. I got the idea of the mind/thought/focus going to a physical location in the body when it was a way of helping with physical distractions, but thoughts and feelings come from the head, so why would the mind ""sink down"" into them?
* Andy says how the question is in the second person so we don't try to engage with it or answer, but at the end of this session specifically said that through the question we realise what we appreciate in life (or words to that effect). Aren't they contradictory statements?

In general I like this idea of dropping a question in, and getting a totally different perspective than if you were to try to answer it directly/intellectually, but for me this question is not a helpful way to introduce this idea.

I currently feel an intense craving to learn the upward market, and I feel enslaved to my desire. I believe it is a healthy desire to have, but I am ultimately unhealthily attached to the outcome. 

I am seeking guidance on applying the middle way to my situation. As to free myself of the suffering I experience due to this perceived enslavement.

* Awakening the Buddha Within

I have yet to find a sangha to which that I can reliably transport. I also have yet to decide on a sect to explore or found a teacher.

I have been contemplating the eightfold path and have been intent (but not perfect) on following the Five Precepts. I have also been following a vegetarian diet.

I have recently noticed how defensive and proud I am in certain aspects, particularly professionally, which I realised is a product of my own self cherishing.

I had an interaction last week that irritated me, where I felt as though my work (and therefore, I) was being negatively judged. I reflected on this and when I calmed down, I realised where the irritation came from. This is a common pattern for me and I know it causes me a lot of irritation and sometimes mild anger as a result. I'm so happy that I've recognised this delusional way of thinking and I'm actively working on it.



**Feeling disrespected**

But now funnily enough, I am dealing with a client who despite being a nice person who I genuinely like, continually shows disrespect through his actions. I certainly don't think he is intentionally disrespectful or malicious (unless he is wearing an extremely convincing mask). He behaves in this way with all colleagues, not just me. Any impartial observer would reasonably see this as continual, disrespectful behaviour.

I have pointed this out to him previously and he was receptive to the feedback. But he continues to act in this way, and despite my patience, the disrespect is obvious and becoming problematic - missed meetings, unpredictable, disrupted schedules and work, overdue payments etc.



**How to act?**

So, given I'm working on my own humility as well as dealing with someone who is continually showing disrespect, I'm not sure what to do about it. My instinct is that I should respectfully walk away from this client to preserve my inner peace. But that's my issue - I'm wondering if this is the 'defensive' ego part of my thinking (""I'm being disrespected, so walk away to preserve your own self respect""), and wonder if I should perhaps maintain the relationship, using it as an opportunity for practice.

i have a very rare understudied invisible condition that has completely destroyed my life and leave me incapable of leaving my home (havent left for 2 years now). my entire universe, life, view on reality has been overturned and i will try to explain the way i am seeing things now... i am living with something almost no one else understands (the condition affects one of my five senses in that almost ANY stimulus related to it becomes painful so almost everything has become torture for me). i am physically incapacitated and often have to go a long time not even able to bathe because almost every movement i make hurts me. Nothing i have tried has worked, no doctors can help or diagnose anything and they dont know wtf is wrong with me. My family takes care of me but the damage it has done to my relationships is astronomical because even just spending time with them saps me of energy and can push my body radically past its limits and im just spent most of my days unable to leave my basement and i am of course also has had massive effects on my family and their lives because of my sudden horrible illness. (4 years going on now and no signs of improvement) There are some things i am still able to do, i can get up and move and just deal with the symptoms for minor things like carefully cleaning or using the bathroom but even that is hard at times, or type on my phone, as well as hold books, that is about it, but even those can become really tiring and painful

I am stuck only with my own brain and books a lot of the time. Im sorry if this is a ramble or inappropriate for this subreddit btw i just need to talk to people who may have some sort of spiritual answer because at this point i feel like i have nothing left to hang on to but the metaphysical. With so much isolated and painful time spent alone there are a lot of thoughts that go through the brain and i just keep feeling all my thoughts drifting back to the connection i want with everything, with my loved ones, with the people ive hurt and who have hurt me, with nature. and how i feel completely fucking cast off from everything that makes life worth it, the relationships, the joy of having a healthy body, the ability to be within nature and feel the wind in your hair that i took for granted. and how im realizing that everything is everything else and everything is everyone and that i completely missed this until sickness completely blew the mask i had assumed for myself off. but the idea of spiritual healing still only feels like an ideal, not something i can believe in totally whem im this sick and still worse. i obviously am in so much pain that i feel like the idea of internalizing the idea that nothing is separate and i am One with it all is so impossible-feeling when my pain and specific circumstances so physically and tangibly reminding me constantly that i Feel separate because my body is such a torturous prison. i dont see any way to escape this when my body, the vessel for the image of separability is so constantly PRESENT because of its pain and abnormal reaction to stimulus

I realized not too long ago that ive always sort of been going down this path of spirituality, i had a moment of believing i was atheist after catholic trauma but it never quite made sense to me either, it wasnt the ideas of the spiritual i inherently hated, just the way it manifested in catholocism... now that i am suffering like ""god"" has come back into myl ife full force but not a bearded man giving out orders in the sky, i dont know fucking what it is but i know its real and it is probably in everything. and i just need to cling onto it cuz i need hope now, hope that this isnt the end, hope that there is more to this when life feels like an illusory sad nightmare fascimile of life, that me and myl oved ones are connected even though i cant be with them. I do not fucking know shit which is why i want to frame this as being unpretentious and just askign for advice really, more wise people here - what would you say to me from your spiritual perspective??

I am just feeling like i am genuienly at the end of my fucking life unexpectedly and need to somehow change, I haven't been a good person in my life and feel so badly need to redeem and spread love to the ppl in my life but my body is a cage. and christianity always felt oppressive and authoritative and not freeing for the spirit in the way buddhism seems to. I downloaded the book Way to the end of Suffering and I read a bit of the intro but im just so scared because this is uncharted territory for me and it feels like my current life is ending and that im already dead in a way which is why i could even start having these overwhelming realizations.  Ive also gotten some tarot readings done lately and they felt undeniably real and prescient to the despair of chronic sickness.  I so badly want to believe in some of the non duality, everything is god and you are not separate from it or anyone else you love, but it is so hard to internalize in a body this sick.

Can someone correct me if this story is wrong?

It seems like Buddhism suggests that peace and happiness lies within, and that we shouldn't depend on anything outside ourselves for happiness. But this conflicts with what the Buddah said.

Is the answer that we should simply seek to reduce suffering in the world, including ourselves and the Sangha and beyond?

# 📷莫留诸教之得道于耳底，唯称本愿之名号于口中。

# This is the meaning of ‘Being without doubts and hesitation.

# 📷称名之外不用我心，此云：“无疑无虑，乘彼愿力，定得往生。”

# “念佛往生”者，

# 📷From the time of no beginning, we living beings have committed immeasurable, innumerable grave offences

# 📷such as the ten evils, the five rebellious acts, the four heavy offences, slandering the Dharma, Icchantika, transgressing the precepts, attaching to improper, deviant views and such like.

# 我等众生，无始以来，成就十恶、五逆、四重、谤法、阐提、破戒、破见等无量无数大罪，

# 📷That is why in future we will suffer great afflictions and torments

# 📷Undergoing acute sufferings in the six paths, the four types of birth and the twenty-five existences unceasingly.

# 因此未来轮回无穷生死，六道、四生、二十五有之间，受大苦恼。

# 📷The Name Namo Amitabha Buddha.

# 📷The Name is the Original Vow for the mundane men to attain a rebirth in his Land.

# 📷Ten kalpas ago, when this Vow was accomplished,

# 📷如十恶，五逆，四重戒杀盗淫妄，毁谤正法，

# An Amitabha reciter will let go of the differentiation in wisdom and stupidity,

# Renounce the good and evil states,

# Let go of the priciples on being honoured or disgraced,

# High or low,

# Leave the mind of terror about hells,

# Leave the mind of seeking for Ultimate Bliss.

# He would also leave the teaching of enlightenment on other sects.

# When everything is renounced

# And with only the recitation of Amitabha Buddha,

# This is in accord with the Original Vows of Amitabha Buddha

# Which far-surpass everything in the world.

# A man who recites the Name of Amitabha Buddha in this way,

# For him there is no Buddha, no-Self.

# What is more to talk about all kinds of reasonings?

# They do not exist either.

So basically my bullet point questions are:

• What's the Buddhist community stance on drugs and other mind/consciusness altering substances?
• What are the disadvantages/advantages to taking/abstaining from drugs and the like?
• What did the buddha say if he did at all about consumption (necessary or not) of drugs and mind/conscious altering substances?
•How should one view drugs according to the standarts of buddhism? And different but still related to this point: 
•How one should view those addicted to drugs and the like?

I attended a 10-day retreat in the Thai Forest Tradition roughly a year ago which was an amazing experience, and feel like I 'unlocked' a new level of awareness with regards to my experience. This felt like a strong period of equanimity for months, but as time has gone by this appears to have faded and a lot of neurotic tendencies have returned. 

I have been recently listening to Ajahn Nyanamoli Thero who stresses the importance of mindfulness and not reacting out of emotions, grasping or aversion. However, I have become stressed by this as I am noticing how I constantly seem to driven by aversion, and feel too weak willed to overcome it.

At work I am really struggling as I avoid tasks that feel uncomfortable, which leads to procrastination and distraction, which adds to the resistance and the cycle continues. As aware as I am of this problem, I seem unable to do anything about it, it often feels insurmountable and this generates feelings of hopelessness and guilt. 

My father is an alcoholic who lives entirely through distraction (smoking, scrolling, drinking) and feel as if I have been strongly conditioned to emulate this pattern of behaviour. As soon as a difficult emotion arises I seem to dissociate/grasp for distraction.

In my meditation practice this seems less of an issue, I feel more equanimous with regards to experience while sitting, but when it comes to engaging with the world it feels so overwhelming that I struggle to remain centered.

I think Aristotle suggests that in fact a tree *is* a single thing, one substance that possesses various properties that are not the tree itself (height, weight, etc), as well as ""sub-substances"" that are also not the tree (leaves, branches, etc).

It seems like this theory could be possible from a conventional point of view. On the other hand it seems absurd that something being a tree or not isn't 100% dependent on/posterior to what its properties and parts are.

*The term 'Protestant Buddhism,' coined by scholar Gananath Obeyesekere, is often applied to Dharmapala's form of Buddhism. It is Protestant in two ways. First, it is influenced by Protestant ideals such as freedom from religious institutions, freedom of conscience, and focus on individual interior experience. Second, it is in itself a protest against claims of Christian superiority, colonialism, and Christian missionary work aimed at weakening Buddhism. ""Its salient characteristic is the importance it assigns to the laity.""[25] It arose among the new, literate, middle class centred in Colombo.*

*The term 'Buddhist modernism' is used to describe forms of Buddhism that suited the Modern World, usually influenced by modern thinking, and often adapted by Buddhists as a counter to claims of European or Christian superiority. Buddhist modernists emphasize certain aspects of traditional Buddhism, while de-emphasizing others.[26] Some of the characteristics of Buddhist modernism are: importance of the laity as against the sangha; rationality and de-emphasis of supernatural and mythological aspects; consistency with (and anticipation of) modern science; emphasis on spontaneity, creativity, and intuition; democratic, anti-institutional character; emphasis on meditation over devotional and ceremonial actions.[26]*

*Dharmapala is an excellent example of a Buddhist modernist, and perhaps the paradigmatic example of Protestant Buddhism. He was particularly concerned with presenting Buddhism as consistent with science, especially the theory of evolution.[27]*

I am familiar with the creation myth of Abrahamic religions (genesis) and others, which is far from being scientific. In my opinion, Agganna Sutta is not the creation mythos that some claim it is.

\---

The discourse begins with 2 Brahmins talking to the Buddha. The Buddha learns that they are being labelled as inferior by their Brahmin peers. The buddha’s begins this discoursed by stating:

· Preface - Brahmins are like everyone else. They are not superior.

· Purification in the 4 classes- Even though people were grouped within 4 different classes at the time, there are good and bad people in all of them.

This part onward is what some people would consider the Buddhist creation mythos. The Buddha preface this by saying that the cosmos will eventually contract, and this universe will end. Sentient being will go to the “realm of streaming radiance” (i.e., the 17th plane of existence). Then, a universe is born again, and beings who “die” in the realm of streaming radiance inhabit the new universe.

· The Earth’s nectar appears- Beings that come into the universe are still uncorrupted. A very long period of time passes Earth’s nectar (matter) is formed. Some beings get attached to the physical as it gives them a type of pleasure, and thus, craving is born.

· The Moon and Sun Appear- Some being desire for craving causes them to shape matter into planets and stars. As the universe starts to fill with matter, the laws of the universe (physics) start to appear (e.g. time, space, gravity…). Since not all creations are equal, some are more “beautiful” than others, this gives rise to inequality due to some beings thinking their creations and themselves as superior to others. 

· Ground-fungus- Another type of craving appears. I believe that ground-fungus is used as an analogy here to something that others would desire rather than actual fungus. Some beings get attached to this new craving . The attachment and inequal distribution of this new craving. Beings who measure their worth through this craving judge others less fortunate than them as inferior, this causes hierarchies to start to form.

From then on, the following sections introduce the addition of more and more cravings. This causes different types of attachments to for.. 

· Bursting Pods 

· Ripe Untilled Ric

·  Gender Appears, 

· Sexual Intercourse

Beings start to form distinct groups where those different from them are banished . Those banished form their own groups. This, in turn, gives rise to more complex hierarchies.

· Dividing the Rice

· The Elected King

· The Circle of Brahmins

· The Circle of peasants

· The circle of Menials

The Buddha mention that these groups are merely hierarchies/classes. Amongst them are beings who can be good or bad, or good and bad. The discourse ends with the Buddha teaching that independent of the group you ascribe to, or are categorised into, this will not be a factor in someone who works toward the goal of achieving awakening.

\---

I think this is not a creation mythos. The only part about the “creation” part is the movement of beings from the realm of streaming radiance to a universe that is being born. About how the first beings in that universe shape the laws and content of that Universe, which itself is a form of attachment/craving.
Everything else seems to be a lesson about Samudaya, which causes Dukkha. Examples like the Earth’s Nectar, Ground-fungus etc…. are not meant to be taken in a literal sense.

In conclusion, I think that the Agganna sutta is a response to the 2 Brahmin on why their Brahmin peers think the way they do. The Buddha’s uses specific terms as analogies on how beings are shaped by their desires and that of others. And also how even though we are being born in a universe shaped by cravings, this does not prevent us from achieving  “awakening”.

This analysis was done in a bit of a rush, so I am expecting that I made some major oversights. I would very much like to know your opinions on this matter and your interpretation of the Agganna sutta so that I am able to improve my own understanding of this discourse.

In hindsight, I'm glad I wrote it out, and I thank anyone who reads through it. 

I've been struggling with suicidal ideation since I was 11, and it's been going on for more than 20 years. I have 2 reasons I have not checked out. 

1. I have a mentally disabled sister, and I know that if I leave before her, the quality of her care will rock-bottom. My family shows little care or compassion. She is entitled to a huge inheritance, but they will still do the bare minimum in terms of expenses.  
2. My spiritual practice prohibits me from taking myself out. 

Having said that, I am going through a small cancer scare. It's nothing serious, like a 10% chance that I might have it. I've been assured that the family money will take care of my medical expenses should it come to that. 

And I realized I dont know if I have will or interest to fight back should I be diagnosed. 

My family broke my wings. I know I will never have a family or partner of my own. My family and childhood broke me down to such a level that I dont see these things happening. Up until 2 years ago, I've always still had a dream of further my intellectual pursuits via doing a masters in communications designs in understanding civic communication principles and how we can better it in the context of helping humanity. 

The funding was supposed to come from my inheritance which is managed by my family. I never worried about my academic costs, knowing that I had my inheritance. The funding was denied on the following basis: 

1. It was punishment for emotional abusing my father(I unleashed 25 years of pent-up anger and held him accountable for abusing my mentally disabled brother and sister)
2. I'm not learning how to run a business

The Masters was the one thing I had....I'm too old to apply for bursaries at this point. 

It's left me feeling like I dont have a purpose, or any goals to look forward to. I'm training right now to join volunteer firefighting, and in that way I have a goal to work towards to, and it serves humanity and nature at the same time. 

I'm struggling to find a purpose that anchors me here, besides being my sister's guardian. My brother passed away. 

We grew up in a dark childhood and my sister is an embodiment  of my mother near suicidal depression and my father's rage. My family is the ultimate thing that drains me, and I cant walk away from it. Technically I can, but I've chosen not to. 

Up until 2 years ago, I was a high functioning alcoholic and stoner, but have managed to change my life style. I took up meditation, and furthering my spiritual understanding of life, I also try to practise stoicism. 

I think I know the answer to my own question. 

That by inaction, I will still be participating in taking my own life...right? 

I'm just struggling to generate will power, all of it is going into just being able to keep a job, afford and clean my home, and being present for my sister. I dont know if I have the willpower to fight off a disease like cancer. Survive for what? A continuation of this existence? 

Apologies if this is depression, I dont mean to be. Maybe I'm being a bit nihilistic?

She showed me care and compassion I'd never experienced, and introduced me to Buddhism so I could discover true healing and my own Sangha. Her warm and big beautiful heart helped me finally close the darkest chapter of my life, one fraught with depression, addiction, and disconnection from self, and I cannot put words to the gratitude and warm glowing love I have for her. Through meditation and self inquiry I've been reconnecting with myself and discovering clarity, capacity, and love laying deep underneath these old pains.

My heart tells me I need to write her a card and pour all of this out into it, to show her the extent of my love and drive I have to be a loving and dedicated partner.

Now I'll share some context. We met and dated under the pretense of ethical nonmonogamy. She was still seeing her last partner of 4 years, who she's said is her best friend and favorite person. She spent time with him and I separately, and as time went on, she said I was meeting more of her needs in tenderness, intimacy, and affection than anyone before. I felt the same towards her.

Her last partner was getting increasingly disenchanted with us together, and was in a lot of pain, so she said she wanted a break from both of us, at least intimately. After 3 weeks, I saw her again, and we connected in a beautifully loving way, ending with perhaps the best sex of our lives. 

She called her last partner the next day and told him, and it undid him. He fell apart emotionally, and she followed suit. I wanted so badly to be there for her, but she left town and wanted little to nothing to do with me for over a week. She returned, we met up, kissed a lot in her car, and she told me that as she listens to her body, she's never felt anything like she has with me. I feel at home with her. Then she said she's too attracted to me to just be friends, and she doesn't know if she sees me as a future partner. She's confused about how to handle her ex-partner, and doesn't know what the future holds between them. She said she'd rather not hang out together for now...

I’m sure my openness to it helped, but really learning how to properly meditate has literally melted away my anxieties like nothing else ever has, and is already helping me a lot with my trauma. I am officially diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and PTSD as well. I got to speak to monks and nuns about how to approach my trauma and fears with mindfulness, and their advice genuinely helped me even after 17 years of ongoing therapy. The atmosphere of the monastery and the sangha friends I made are so different from anything I’ve ever encountered in my adult life. In the best way. I felt like a child again, also in the best way. I wish I could share this feeling with everyone I care for, but I know you cannot force anyone to practice. All you can do is lead by example. But this feeling of peace that I have access to now is something totally unique.

The Buddhist trade fair opened on 11 May 2019 in the city of Xiamen, China, one of many that are organized here throughout the year. Our mission in visiting the fair was to find new and interesting gadgets that play recordings of Buddhist chants, sutras, *dhāraṇīs*, and mantras. My interest in these electronic devices, known as *nianfoji* (念佛机), began in the Zhongnan Mountains in 2008, when Master Juecun, abbot of one of the Buddhist temples in this mountainous region at the time, gave me a small, blue, plastic box, with a figure of Amitabha Buddha in the middle and two phrases engraved on either side.Despite being so small, one could listen at a surprisingly high volume to five versions of the repetition of the mantra Namo Amituofo. The pilgrim could hang this nianfoji around his neck and listen to the mantras while climbing the mountain. I was quite fascinated by the aesthetic and sound of these little devices and wanted to find out more about their origin, the value they have to devotees, and the different designs. Over the years, I began collecting one here and one there when I came across them at Buddhist temples and Chinese shops. I noticed that several of them played recitations of the Pure Land Buddhist teacher Master Jing Kong (b. 1927; also known as Master Chin Kung), who is renowned for being one of the first Chinese monks to use technology to spread the Buddhist teachings.

In one of his teachings on YouTube, the master speaks of the importance of leaving the *nianfoji* on 24 hours a day, since even if we cannot hear them at night because we are asleep, hungry ghosts can. Master Jing Kong claims that many hungry ghosts want to be released from their state and hope to reach the Pure Land: “If we leave the *nianfoji* turned on 24 hours a day, then we will help those who are in the Youmingjie \[underworld\]. The ghosts are also your protectors and there are many inside your house. If you don’t let them listen to the recitations, they will forget to recite to the Buddha.”\*

Despite their attraction as religious objects, I was surprised at the almost complete lack of research surrounding *nianfoji*. A study by Natasha Heller (2014) stands out among the handful conducted. After analyzing the *nianfoji*, she mentions the way in which, despite being mechanical chanting, the devices emulate the sacred sounds that are spontaneously emitted in the setting of Western Paradise, where Pure Land Buddhists aspire to be reborn.

We know that chants and recitations have played an essential role in the spread and popularization of Buddhism in China. The first *fanbai* (Skt: *bhasa* or “recitation of scripture”) were from the period of the Three Kingdoms (220–80 CE) and the Northern and Southern dynasties (386–589 CE). Throughout the period of Chinese dynasties, the *fanbai* would be the most widely renowned sacred chants in the ecclesiastical and lay worlds of Buddhism. (Chen 2005) Over the course of China’s history, there were a series of reformulations and developments in Buddhist chants, especially in the period of the Republic of China (1912–49) and once again during the economic opening of the 1980s. Faced with the need to modernize the country, Buddhists began to disseminate doctrines via different mediums: journals, CDs, videos, and even religious karaoke. (Ríos 2017) And from among this diversity of media, these little sound gadgets started to spread, which at first only played a limited number of chants and recitations. However, today we can find an astonishing assortment of *nianfoji* that contain hundreds of recordings, recitations of complete sutras, and a wide range of designs featuring Buddhist symbols such as the lotus flower and the Pure Land triad: Amitabha Buddha with two bodhisattvas: Guanyin (Avalokiteshvara) and Dashizhi (Mahasthamaprapta)—boxes of various sizes with different motifs, small altars, buddhas, bodhisattvas, and a slew of other designs, with high-level sound and advanced digital technology.

Although Heller points out that these devices are not intedned to replace individual recitation, one of the intentions of Chinese Buddhist recitation is to gain merit or a real and effective response from the Buddha. The *nianfoji* do help to create a suitable spiritual environment, but more importantly, the experiences that Buddhist devotees recount of their *nianfoji* would seem to stimulate the Buddha, and they often receive miraculous responses and, thus, merit.

In this regard, we not only find the interpretation of Master Jing Kong and the possibility of liberating hungry ghosts with the recitations issuing forth from the devices, but there are also diverse examples of devotees who experience *ganying* by leaving their *nianfoji* turned on. *Ganying* is a mode of spontaneous response that occurs naturally in a universe holistically conceived in terms of patterns and interdependent order. Resonance is the mechanism by which categorically related albeit spatially distant phenomena interact. The concept of *ganying* in Chinese Buddhist interpretations takes on a doctrinal and soteriological value that is palpable in the thousands of tales of devotees who experience *ganying* with buddhas and bodhisattvas. In Buddhism, the principle of *ganying* was used to explain celestial omens, moral retribution, ritual efficacy, natural and astronomical cycles, political upheavals, and so on. (Sharf 2002)

Some of these examples refer to a person who dreamed of non-Buddhist family members by chanting Amituofo (Amitabha Buddha) and, upon awaking, realized that he had left the *nianfoji* turned on the entire night. This same person said that when he turned on the device, animals came to his home to listen to the recitations from the device. (Ríos 2017) Other stories of a more auspicious nature recount, for example, the sad life of a woman who was beaten by her drunk husband. One day she found Buddhism and obtained a *nianfoji* that she left on the entire day in the house. Since then, her spouse stopped drinking, no longer beat her, and helped their son to do his homework.\*\* 

In another story from 2015, a group of secular devotees decided to visit a woman living in misery in a rural area. The woman had a 28-year-old son and a 32-year-old daughter who both had mental illnesses. The son lived somewhere else, isolated, because he was occasionally violent. The daughter lived with her mother and, after a relationship turned sour, she became mentally ill. The woman had not gotten out of bed for nine years. The devotees brought a *nianfoji* with them as a gift when they visited and also left them money. That same afternoon, the mother left the *nianfoji* turned on. On the third day, the daughter unexpectedly got out of bed and recovered.

As you can see, these little gadgets would seem to have acquired real power among Chinese devotees that suggests empathetic resonance or *ganying* with the Buddha, stimulating his healing power and compassion through the recitations and resulting in an auspicious response.

With the aim of highlighting their value as religious material culture and as objects of power in Chinese Buddhism, I decided to keep a small collection of *nianfoji* and to continue enquiring into their use and the stories told about these devices. With the support of Top China Grants from Banco Santander at the Catholic University of Chile (UC), Prof. Hugo Palmarola at the Design School and Fondecyt Research Funds (No. 3190076), we started a project that consisted of compiling a collection of *nianfoji* and then hosting an exhibition.

That is how we ended up attending the Xiamen fair, as well as visiting several Taobao webpages selling *nianfoji* and scores of Buddhist shops in China. We managed to collect 50 devices for the exhibition, which would have been held in Santiago de Chile in 2020, but was postponed due to the pandemic. However, we have made a video in which we share a small sampling of *nianfoji*, and we explain them on *Buddhistdoor en Español*. As noted in the video, the wide range of designs and aesthetics have continued to evolve over the years, and with the onset of new technologies, the quality in recent models has risen significantly. 

Although smartphones and Buddhist apps integrating the functions of *nianfoji* have gradually replaced these devices, and many older models may now be discontinued, new designs are still being created and promoted online, fascinating everyone who enjoys unusual curios whose sacred chants may well reach the ears of the Buddha.

## The Mahāmudrā Practice of Stillness, Movement and Awareness

***by Mipham Rinpoche***

When you are able to practice Mahāmudrā’s three simple categories of  stillness, movement and awareness, the crucial point of ultimately  seeing the truth of dharmatā comes about due to the presence of the  buddha-nature (*sugatagarbha*) and an application of the key  points based on the pith instructions. Since the root of all phenomena  lies in the mind, it is through seeking the key to your own mind that  you will come to know mind’s secret, gain insight into all phenomena,  and realize the nature of selflessness. For this, we can therefore  dispense with excessive theoretical analysis and follow instead the pith  instructions of the realized ones. 

When you turn within and look into your own mind, if it abides without any movement, that is what is referred to as *stillness*. When various forms of conceptualization occur, that is *movement*. And in either case, the mind’s own capacity to know itself is what we call *awareness*.  If you sustain this continuously, you will discover for yourself the  key point of how various experiences of joy or sorrow arise from the  mind itself and dissolve back into it. As long as you understand this,  you’ll recognize that all perceptions are but the manifestations of your  own mind. Then, by looking directly into mind’s essence, whether it is  still or active, you will understand that even though it manifests in  varied ways, it’s empty and lacks any kind of true essence. You will  know too that this emptiness is not a blankness like empty space but an  emptiness that includes the most sublime of features, since while it is  devoid of any true reality its unceasing clarity still has the capacity  to know and be aware of everything. When you understand mind’s crucial  secret in this way, the looker and that which is looked at are not  separate, but there is an experience of genuine mind-as-such with its  own natural luminosity. This is known as the recognition of awareness  and is what is pointed out in Mahāmudrā and Dzogchen. If you can sustain  this, your experience will develop as Saraha explained:

>As you look and look into the sky-like nature  
 That has always been pure, seeing recedes.   
 

This is also the message of the Mother Prajñāpāramitā:

>Mind is devoid of mind; the nature of mind is clear light.  
 

There is nothing easier than this. Putting it into practice is crucial.

In the Theravadin tradition I have not found much awareness of or acknowledgement of such phenomenon, and hope others can share sources from any tradition of Buddhism which they think relevant.

I have however met individual monks of the Theravadin tradition who certainly, to my satisfaction, demonstrated siddhis.

This was not declared by them or done in any public way, nor manner in which most people would be aware of them, but I observed two monks together at a Theravadin monastery outside of their bodies in what is commonly called ""astral"" form on the physical plane.

As soon as they became aware I could perceive them, both fled instantly through the wall and I did not become aware of which of the monks of the sangha it was or noticed them in such a form again for the rest of my stay.

If you have experienced it, you will know exactly what it is like to perceive such phenomenon and I would wager it would be very similar, but I don't have many other people to refer to for comparison.

This happened on the first night of a rains retreat for which I was attending the monastery to give service.

Does anyone else have any experiences of observing siddhis of any kind, in any sangha or practitioner of any Buddhist tradition?

I am aware there may be people who would like to debunk such phenomena and experiences, but having with certainty experienced a number of such things directly I still understand the disbelief of those who might have not. 

I am not particularly interested in the speculations of those who have not had such experiences, nor find such opinions credible or relevant, just as they are entitled to think of my own however they wish.

First say for simplicity karma are the willingly actions of body speech and mind, and their results. In this context of avoiding suffering the precepts are given. 

For avoiding creating conditions of life suffering and short life and the lower realms, for avoid suffering due to not having, for avoid suffering due to sexuality, for avoiding suffering due to speech or non truth and for avoiding negligence due to intoxicants and alcohol... And like guides for avoiding creating conditions of suffering and causes for the lower realms. Only in this context of causes and conditions Buddha gave precepts, those not are mandatory but for the benefit of beings. And the Buddha knew these karmic laws but he not created those. Also aren't limited therefore there are adittional vows and precepts

There we have the difference in monastics and lay people. Monastics are renunciants, they renunciate looking to attain fastest liberation from samsara, in the main historical sense they renunciate common things to attain higher purer. In that sense they have more rules looking to avoid any obstacle to liberation and to create the better conditions to liberation. In that way they were given rules to not farming and only go for ailms. In the sense of they avoiding any possibility of karma related to harming living beings and, while the lay people accumulated merit for providing those in vows. Also stipulating rules about not damaging seeds or plants. The better way for avoiding bad karma of body and speech is in the monastic rules. About mind karma there's no defined difference, logically the monasticism can control actions of body and speech but not control the actions of mind of the monastic community...

In the wide sense, while we are here we need a lot of things, and many of those things affect other and others. In many ways is very difficult to have house or food without affecting and harming other living beings. In the non monastic way to avoid there's a conditioned limitation. Very clearly in the need of herds of animals in many cultures, or fishing. Or in the techniques and advance in agriculture. On the other way, there are not limitations in the amount of good karma lay people can do, karma associated to health, having all the needed, sexuality without harm, good speech and avoiding negligence due to intoxicants and alcohol. Simply the wiser and nobler(arya) the recipient of generosity is, the better the result we are causing. Then while we in fact need to eat, the more generosity and wise and good karma we do  the better for us and for all beings. 

We cannot know the karma we did in the very past and previous lives. And isn't benefitting the feeling of guilt. Only control possible results in the actions from now to the future. On the other aspect only a Buddha know perfectly the results of actions for each being and perfectly the future lives given conditions

Other religions and philosophies have some insight and beneficial rules in this sense, both for happiness into samsara and for the unconditioned happiness due to liberation from samsara cycle of conditioned  rebirths.

I say this in terms of a colloquial use of the word lonely.  

As in, so much of Buddhism happens by looking inward, and mostly in the company of oneself. 

As somebody who was raised Catholic, one of the biggest draws of the faith for me at the time was the community. Big potlucks and meals after church together, getting to know your neighbors and the people in your religious community. I always found that to be very heartwarming and joyful. Especially around the holidays. I could meet new people all the time. Hear different life stories and gossip. It was just fun, even as a kid I saw it as a fun time. I met some cool friends during those after church activities as well. Sometimes there would even be games. 

When it comes to Buddhism, I feel like that's prohibitively difficult to do. At least at my local monastery, it really is just guided meditation, if you're lucky a Sutta class once per week. There's no events that bring the community together, at least not the English speaking community. 

The contrast becomes stark because there is a Catholic Church close to the monastery, and every time I drive past it on my way to sutta class  guided meditation, I hear the music, laughter, I can smell the food. Brings it back to my childhood and a sense of community that I deeply miss. 

I have talked to the monks at  the monster about doing something like, but monks can't eat after 12, so that really limits the kind of afternoon activities that might be hosted. Monks have to follow so many precepts, so no music, and very little type of leisure activities. 

The nature of Buddhism is one of non-attachment, and so a lot of the ""fun"" leisure activities that would build community just don't seem to happen at the monasteries.

I don't know, It just feels like a very lonely path. One aiming for the cessation of suffering yes, but also one without that much laughter. At least that's been my experience over the last year of my practice.

I don't know if its the right subtype to post this, but I try to be closer to buddhism and meditate in my everyday life.

Nonetheless I'm a very anxious person with ocd.

At the moment I'm having really bad problems with insomnia and it's extending to totally unreasonable stuff, always related to one of my roommates.

I'm always scared my roomate is judging me for my lifestyle (even if it is quite normal, but in the morning I often snooze my alarm) but I think it's mostly the fact she hears a lot of what I do and it feels suffocating even if she did nothing wrong. We share a bathroom on the same floor and the doors are quite noisy.

I'm also scared to disturb her, for example scared my alarm in the morning might annoy/wake her up if I don't turn it off right away/snooze.
I also feel bad if I go to the bathroom several times if I can't sleep because I know she hears me, even if she already told me that I'm quiet, I'm now afraid to not be quite enough.

I think I'm hyperaware of everything I do and with her presence, I feel it much more and I'm always scared to be annoying to her with noises.
I dont know why this gives me so much anxiety but it's like to the point I'm afraid to do yoga in my room because the vibrations might wake her or something.

I know she doesn't spy on me but she's very observant and already made comments about some stuff of my lifestyle (not mean at all).

I feel like I'm really becoming insane, it's like even when I'm in my room I feel the presence of this girl

I have this feeling my mind can't be at peace unless I'm living alone but it's a conception of my mind.
And I feel like when I read sacred texts it never corresponds exactly to what I'm feeling/living.

I hope its clear, and that you can give me some thoughts on that.

Thanks so much and peace on you all 🙏🙏

Buddhist ontology is completely different than typical Western/Christian ontology because it is starting from fundamentally different axiomatic assumptions, hence why it is perfectly logical to end up with the ideas of non-self, no creator diety, and the like while those operating from a Western/Christian framework can logically come to the opposite conclusions because those starting axioms allow for, or even necessitate it.

As a mother of a 9 year old child, I have a strong wish for her to live a happy and peaceful life. However, I understand that no matter how carefully I shelter and protect her, eventually she must face challenges in life on her own. The best thing I can do for her right now is to help plant and nurture the wholesome seeds of kindness and compassion, wisdom and patience in a spacious mind and an inclusive heart. Because only from that foundation, can she truly live a free and happy life.

Realizing the importance for young children to have an education program that focuses on nurturing the mind, embracing the heart, and building morality, Ven. Thich Tam Tien has graciously accepted our invitation to teach a Buddhism class for children (age of 6-12). He will apply The Buddha's teaching to strengthen the positive qualities in the young minds and hearts. Our Dharma master (we call “Thay” in Vietnamese) has spent many years studying and teaching Buddhism in the US. Thay has a Master's Degree in Buddhism from Harvard University. He is now pursuing a Doctorate Degree in Ministry at Boston University. He has lead many Buddhist retreats and camps for young children. Most of all is the love and care Thay has for nurturing the young generation who are the future of our society in general and Buddhism in particular.

The class will be held via ZOOM, EVERY THURSDAY from 8:00pm-8:45pm (EST) starting MAY 9, 2024. Class is free of charge. If you would like your child to join the class, please contact Dieu Bao via email: [ngoc9999@gmail.com](mailto:ngoc9999@gmail.com) or text: 517-897-4437 to register.

With loving kindness and compassion,

After doing some more research, I found controversy about him and support of Nazism and rejection of westernization of Buddhism. It has made me very, very wary to read or even keep the book. I did find this on Wikipedia, however:

“In cases where Suzuki directly expresses his position on the contemporary political situation—whether in his articles, public talks, or letters to friends (in which he would have had no reason to misrepresent his views)—he is clear and explicit in his distrust of and opposition to State Shinto, rightwing thought, and the other forces that were pushing Japan toward militarism and war, even as he expressed interest in decidedly non-rightist ideologies like socialism. In this Suzuki's standpoint was consistent from the late nineteenth century through to the postwar years. These materials reveal in Suzuki an intellectual independence, a healthy scepticism of political ideology and government propaganda, and a sound appreciation for human rights.”

That seems different than the picture I was seeing painted about him!

My aunt's name is Chen Yu Xian. Due to a shortage of staff at the handicraft gift shop I manage, she was deeply concerned about me and took the initiative to assist me in running the business. Each day, she encountered fellow practitioners who visited the shop and shared teachings of the Pure Land Dharma with me. They all experienced profound joy in their discussions of the Dharma. Influenced by their sharing, my aunt also gradually accepted Amitabha Buddha's compassionate salvation, joined our group in reciting Buddha, and frequently encouraged her nearby friends to join us by sharing certain karmic principles to them, aiming to guide them towards embracing and reciting ""Namo Amitabha Buddha.""

One of her close friends learned of her embrace of Buddhism and recounted a peculiar incident that had recently occurred in their household.

She and her husband harbored a deep affection for animals and kept a large wolfhound at home, which they cherished dearly. This situation continued for several years.

One evening, as they prepared for bed, they suddenly heard a woman wailing in agony outside their window, which was very terrifying. Strangely, their residence was situated on a high floor with no other residents nearby, and this occurred consistently for three consecutive nights.

The husband was so frightened by this incident that he fell ill and required hospitalization. Despite numerous examinations, the cause of his illness remained unclear. After over a month in the hospital, he was discharged to rest at home. Upon returning, their typically gentle wolfhound exhibited unusual aggression upon seeing the husband, barking incessantly, then writhing on the ground as if grappling with something. After a moment, the dog ultimately collapsed and passed away. My aunt's friends and her husband were both devastated by the sudden death of their beloved pet. Curiously, after their dog's sudden death, the illness that had baffled the husband's doctors miraculously recovered. They found the entire sequence of events deeply puzzling.

After some time, the husband had a very strange dream. He dreamed that their deceased dog appeared to tell him that the crying woman they had recently heard was actually a female ghost who held a grudge against the husband in the past. Now, conditions were ripe, so she had come to claim the husband's life. Because they had always been so kind to the dog, in order to repay their kindness, the dog fought with the female ghost and died for the husband. Now that the favor to the husband and his wife had been returned, and the negative karma of the female ghost had been cleared, the dog purposely came to inform him in the dream.

Upon learning about this strange incident, my aunt thought: ""Isn't this a vivid example of cause and effect in real life?"" Therefore, she often used this incident to persuade people to believe in the law of cause and effect and sincerely recite ""Namo Amitabha Buddha,"" aspiring to seek rebirth in Amitabha Buddha's Pure Land.

One day, my aunt had a strange dream. She dreamed that she was lying in bed, when she was  about to fall asleep, she suddenly saw a large wolfhound sitting upright outside the window of her ninth-floor apartment. The wolfhound looked very gentle, so she gestured for it to come to her side. As if understanding her thoughts, the wolfhound flew to the bedside obediently and leaned its head against hers. She was very curious and said to it, ""Doggy, how come you're floating in the air? You seem so pitiful now. If you don't recite 'Namo Amitabha Buddha', you'll be a dog in your next life too. Let me teach you to recite the Buddha's name! Once you learn to recite the Buddha's name, Amitabha Buddha will take you to his Western Pure Land, and you'll never be a dog again. I'll teach you to recite the Buddha's name now. Come, recite with me!""

So, my aunt gently fondled the dog's head with one hand while teaching it to recite the Buddha's name, ""Namo Amitabha Buddha! Namo Amitabha Buddha! Namo Amitabha Buddha..."" After a while, the dog seemed to understand what my aunt trying to express, and then it disappeared!

The following day, my aunt felt that the dream was incredibly real, so she shared the details with me. I believe it might have been because my aunt frequently mentioned the wolfhound, forming a karmic connection with it. The doggy recognized that my aunt was reciting ""Namo Amitabha Buddha"" and knowing that she could assist it in transcending the endless reincarnation. Therefore, it appeared in her dream to request that she dedicate the merit of reciting the Buddha's name to it so that it attain liberation from samsara.

🪷🪷🪷🪷🪷🪷🪷🪷🪷🪷🪷🪷🪷🪷🪷🪷🪷🪷

As I write this passage, I'm deeply moved as well. Even as an animal, the doggy displayed a remarkable loyalty and selflessness towards its owner, sacrificing itself for their sake. Reflecting on this, it's disheartening to consider how few humans exhibit such righteousness in today's world. It is truly worth a sigh.

When will the cycle of reincarnation come to an end? Reflecting on the owner of the righteous dog and the female ghost who sought to claim his life, I wonder whether in this life or in past lives, what evil cause led to such dire consequences. It's a stark reminder that the law of cause and effect is absolutely true and cannot be deceived. Yet, as sentient beings, we remain shrouded in ignorance, often lacking awareness even amidst calamity. This, too, adds to my sense of lamentation.

Although the righteous dog has already passed away, it sensed the compassion of Amitabha, so it sent a dream to my aunt so that she could teach it to recite the Buddha's name, thereby encountering the salvation of Amitabha and attaining rebirth in Amitabha Buddha's Pure Land. Through this incident, I deeply feel the compassion and vow power of Amitabha Buddha, who equally saves all sentient beings with his profound name. It's inconceivable; this is another reason for my sigh.

is zen sexist?

i’ve been a routine zazen practitioner for about a year now. i’m a regular at my local zen center. i even lived there for 3 months, i no longer reside at the center.

i am becoming suspicious that the practice of zazen is some how sexist. at my zen center we have zazen practice 2-4 times a week. and it’s heavily male dominated. id say the average night is 8 men to 2 women. our abbot is a man as well. 

on top of that i’ve noticed that every time i’ve been recommended a book on zen, it’s written by a man. in only one zen book i’ve read in the past few months, only one quote has come from a buddhist nun. 

i’ll note that my particular zen center belongs to the kwan um school of zen.

is this an issue that is consistent in other zen centers? is this an issue that is common is other sects of zen/buddhism? 

ill also add that i am a 26yo male that identifies as non binary. i live in the american midwest.

An interesting point that we might encounter early in our Buddhist practice is the necessity of suffering.  One might even be excused for saying that suffering is desirable to an extent, although, of course, we must not fetishize suffering by becoming attached to it as a goal in its own right.  Instead, suffering is necessary because it is only by directly facing and learning to let go of suffering that we can develop certain aspects of insight that are, themselves, necessary components of what the Buddha identified as enlightenment.

In Thich Nhat Hanh's introductory book, *The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching*, for example, suffering is immediately identified as a ""holy truth,"" without which growth and realization are impossible:

>***Without suffering, you cannot grow. Without suffering, you cannot get the peace and joy you deserve***. Please don’t run away from your suffering. Embrace it and cherish it. Go to the Buddha, sit with him, and show him your pain. He will look at you with loving kindness, compassion, and mindfulness, and show you ways to embrace your suffering and look deeply into it. With understanding and compassion, you will be able to heal the wounds in your heart, and the wounds in the world. ***The Buddha called suffering a Holy Truth, because our suffering has the capacity of showing us the path to liberation. Embrace your suffering, and let it reveal to you the way to peace***.  (p. 5) (emphasis added).

This teaching on the necessity of suffering is not limited to Zen or even Mahayana traditions.  It is a foundational principle of the Dharma/Dhamma entire.  Indeed, I was overjoyed to read a [dhamma talk](https://www.ajahnchah.org/book/Training_Heart1_2.php) by Ajahn Chah, posted in part the other day by u/dehont.  I found the talk so impactful that I wanted to post it's full text here for everyone to have an opportunity to review:

>In the time of Ajahn Mun and Ajahn Sao life was a lot simpler, a lot less complicated than it is today. In those days monks had few duties and ceremonies to perform. They lived in the forests without permanent resting places. There they could devote themselves entirely to the practice of meditation.

>In those times one rarely encountered the luxuries that are so commonplace today, there simply weren't any. One had to make drinking cups and spittoons out of bamboo and lay people seldom came to visit. One didn't want or expect much and was content with what one had. One could live and breathe meditation!

>The monks suffered many privations living like this. If someone caught malaria and went to ask for medicine, the teacher would say, ''You don't need medicine! Keep practicing''. Besides, there simply weren't all the drugs that are available now. All one had were the herbs and roots that grew in the forest. The environment was such that monks had to have a great deal of patience and endurance; they didn't bother over minor ailments. Nowadays you get a bit of an ache and you're off to the hospital!

>Sometimes one had to walk ten to twelve kilometers on almsround. You would leave as soon as it was light and maybe return around ten or eleven o'clock. One didn't get very much either, perhaps some glutinous rice, salt or a few chilis. Whether you got anything to eat with the rice or not didn't matter. That's the way it was. No one dared complain of hunger or fatigue; they were just not inclined to complain but learned to take care of themselves. They practiced in the forest with patience and endurance alongside the many dangers that lurked in the surroundings. There were many wild and fierce animals living in the jungles and there were many hardships for body and mind in the ascetic practice of the *dhutanga* or forest-dwelling monk. Indeed, the patience and endurance of the monks in those days was excellent because the circumstances compelled them to be so.

>In the present day, circumstances compel us in the opposite direction. In ancient times, one had to travel by foot; then came the oxcart and then the automobile. Aspiration and ambition increased, so that now, if the car is not air-conditioned, one will not even sit in it; impossible to go if there is no air-conditioning! The virtues of patience and endurance are becoming weaker and weaker. The standards for meditation and practice are lax and getting laxer, until we find that meditators these days like to follow their own opinions and desires. When the old folks talk about the old days, it's like listening to a myth or a legend. You just listen indifferently, but you don't understand. It just doesn't reach you!

>As far as we should be concerned about the ancient monks' tradition, a monk should spend at least five years with his teacher. Some days you should avoid speaking to anyone. Don't allow yourself to speak or talk very much. Don't read books! Read your own heart instead. Take Wat Pah Pong for example. These days many university graduates are coming to ordain. I try to stop them from spending their time reading books about Dhamma, because these people are always reading books. They have so many opportunities for reading books, but opportunities for reading their own hearts are rare. So, when they come to ordain for three months following the Thai custom, we try to get them to close their books and manuals. While they are ordained they have this splendid opportunity to read their own hearts.

>Listening to your own heart is really very interesting. This untrained heart races around following its own untrained habits. It jumps about excitedly, randomly, because it has never been trained. Therefore train your heart! Buddhist meditation is about the heart; to develop the heart or mind, to develop your own heart. This is very, very important. This training of the heart is the main emphasis. Buddhism is the religion of the heart. Only this! One who practices to develop the heart is one who practices Buddhism.

>This heart of ours lives in a cage, and what's more, there's a raging tiger in that cage. If this maverick heart of ours doesn't get what it wants, it makes trouble. You must discipline it with meditation, with *samādhi*. This is called ""Training the Heart."" At the very beginning, the foundation of practice is the establishment of moral discipline (*sīla*). *Sīla* is the training of the body and speech. From this arises conflict and confusion. When you don't let yourself do what you want to do, there is conflict.

>Eat little! Sleep little! Speak little! Whatever it may be of worldly habit, lessen them, go against their power. Don't just do as you like, don't indulge in your thought. Stop this slavish following. You must constantly go against the stream of ignorance. This is called ""discipline."" When you discipline your heart, it becomes very dissatisfied and begins to struggle. It becomes restricted and oppressed. When the heart is prevented from doing what it wants to do, it starts wandering and struggling. Suffering (*dukkha*) becomes apparent to us.

>This *dukkha*, this suffering, is the first of the four noble truths. Most people want to get away from it. They don't want to have any kind of suffering at all. Actually, this suffering is what brings us wisdom; it makes us contemplate *dukkha*. Happiness (*sukha*) tends to make us close our eyes and ears. It never allows us to develop patience. Comfort and happiness make us careless. Of these two defilements, *Dukkha* is the easiest to see. Therefore we must bring up suffering in order to put an end to our suffering. We must first know what *dukkha* is before we can know how to practice meditation.

>In the beginning you have to train your heart like this. You may not understand what is happening or what the point of it is, but when the teacher tells you to do something, then you must do it. You will develop the virtues of patience and endurance. Whatever happens, you endure, because that is the way it is. For example, when you begin to practice *samādhi* you want peace and tranquility. But you don't get any. You don't get any because you have never practiced this way. Your heart says, ""I'll sit until I attain tranquillity."" But when tranquillity doesn't arise, you suffer. And when there is suffering, you get up and run away! To practice like this can not be called ""developing the heart."" It's called ""desertion.""

>Instead of indulging in your moods, you train yourself with the Dhamma of the Buddha. Lazy or diligent, you just keep on practicing. Don't you think that this is a better way? The other way, the way of following your moods, will never reach the Dhamma. If you practice the Dhamma, then whatever the mood may be, you keep on practicing, constantly practicing. The other way of self-indulgence is not the way of the Buddha. When we follow our own views on practice, our own opinions about the Dhamma, we can never see clearly what is right and what is wrong. We don't know our own heart. We don't know ourselves.

>Therefore, to practice following your own teachings is the slowest way. To practice following the Dhamma is the direct way. Lazy you practice; diligent you practice. You are aware of time and place. This is called ""developing the heart.""

>If you indulge in following your own views and try to practice accordingly, then you will start thinking and doubting a lot. You think to yourself, ""I don't have very much merit. I don't have any luck. I've been practicing meditation for years now and I'm still unenlightened. I still haven't seen the Dhamma."" To practice with this kind of attitude can not be called ""developing the heart."" It is called ""developing disaster.""

>If, at this time, you are like this, if you are a meditator who still doesn't know, who doesn't see, if you haven't renewed yourself yet, it's because you've been practicing wrongly. You haven't been following the teachings of the Buddha. The Buddha taught like this: ""Ananda, practice a lot! Develop your practice constantly! Then all your doubts, all your uncertainties, will vanish."" These doubts will never vanish through thinking, nor through theorizing, nor through speculation, nor through discussion. Nor will doubts disappear by not doing anything. All defilements will vanish through developing the heart, through right practice only.

>The way of developing the heart as taught by the Buddha is the exact opposite of the way of the world, because his teachings come from a pure heart. A pure heart, unattached to defilements, is the Way of the Buddha and his disciples.

>If you practice the Dhamma, you must bow your heart to the Dhamma. You must not make the Dhamma bow to you. When you practice this way. suffering arises. There isn't a single person who can escape this suffering. So when you commence your practice suffering is right there.

>The duties of meditators are mindfulness, collectedness and contentment. These things stop us. They stop the habits of the hearts of those who have never trained. And why should we bother to do this? If you don't bother to train your heart, then it remains wild, following the ways of nature. It's possible to train that nature so that it can be used to advantage. This is comparable to the example of trees. If we just left trees in their natural state, then we would never be able to build a house with them. We couldn't make planks or anything of use in building a house. However, if a carpenter came along wanting to build a house, he would go looking for trees such as these. He would take this raw material and use it to advantage. In a short time he could have a house built.

>Meditation and developing the heart are similar to this. You must take this untrained heart, the same as you would take a tree in its natural state in the forest, and train this natural heart so that it is more refined, so that it's more aware of itself and is more sensitive. Everything is in its natural state. When we understand nature, then we can change it, we can detach from it, we can let go of it. Then we won't suffer anymore.

>The nature of our heart is such that whenever it clings and grasps there is agitation and confusion. First it might wander over there, then it might wander over here. When we come to observe this agitation, we might think that it's impossible to train the heart and so we suffer accordingly. We don't understand that this is the way the heart is. There will be thought and feelings moving about like this even though we are practicing, trying to attain peace. That's the way it is.

>When we have contemplated many times the nature of the heart, then we will come to understand that this heart is just as it is and can't be otherwise. We will know that the heart's ways are just as they are. That's its nature. If we see this clearly, then we can detach from thoughts and feelings. And we don't have to add on anything more by constantly having to tell ourselves that ""that's just the way it is."" When the heart truly understands, it lets go of everything. Thinking and feeling will still be there, but that very thinking and feeling will be deprived of power.

>This is similar to a child who likes to play and frolic in ways that annoy us, to the extent that we scold or spank him. We should understand that it's natural for a child to act that way. Then we could let go and leave him to play in his own way. So our troubles are over. How are they over? Because we accept the ways of children. Our outlook changes and we accept the true nature of things. We let go and our heart becomes more peaceful. We have ""right understanding.""

>If we have wrong understanding, then even living in a deep, dark cave would be chaos, or living high up in the air would be chaos. The heart can only be at peace when there is ""right understanding."" Then there are no more riddles to solve and no more problems to arise.

>This is the way it is. You detach. You let go. Whenever there is any feeling of clinging, we detach from it, because we know that that very feeling is just as it is. It didn't come along especially to annoy us. We might think that it did, but in truth it is just that way. If we start to think and consider it further, that too, is just as it is. If we let go, then form is merely form, sound is merely sound, odor is merely odor, taste is merely taste, touch is merely touch and the heart is merely the heart. It's similar to oil and water. If you put the two together in a bottle, they won't mix because of the difference in their nature.

>Oil and water are different in the same way that a wise man and an ignorant man are different. The Buddha lived with form, sound, odor, taste, touch and thought. He was an *arahant* (enlightened one), so He turned away from rather than toward these things. He turned away and detached little by little since He understood that the heart is just the heart and thought is just thought. He didn't confuse and mix them together.

>The heart is just the heart; thoughts and feelings are just thoughts and feelings. Let things be just as they are! Let form be just form, let sound be just sound, let thought be just thought. Why should we bother to attach to them? If we think and feel in this way, then there is detachment and separateness. Our thoughts and feelings will be on one side and our heart will be on the other. Just like oil and water – they are in the same bottle but they are separate.

>The Buddha and his enlightened disciples lived with ordinary, unenlightened people. They not only lived with these people, but they taught these ordinary, unenlightened, ignorant ones how to be noble, enlightened, wise ones. They could do this because they knew how to practice. They knew that it's a matter of the heart, just as I have explained.

>So, as far as your practice of meditation goes, don't bother to doubt it. If we run away from home to ordain, it's not running away to get lost in delusion. Nor out of cowardice or fear. It's running away in order to train ourselves, in order to master ourselves. If we have understanding like this, then we can follow the Dhamma. The Dhamma will become clearer and clearer. The one who understands the Dhamma, understands himself; and the one who understands himself, understands the Dhamma. Nowadays, only the sterile remains of the Dhamma have become the accepted order. In reality, the Dhamma is everywhere. There is no need to escape to somewhere else. Instead escape through wisdom. Escape through intelligence. Escape through skill. don't escape through ignorance. If you want peace, then let it be the peace of wisdom. That's enough!

>Whenever we see the Dhamma, then there is the right way, the right path. Defilements are just defilements, the heart is just the heart. Whenever we detach and separate so that there are just these things as they really are, then they are merely objects to us. When we are on the right path, then we are impeccable. When we are impeccable, there is openness and freedom all the time.

>The Buddha said, ""Listen to me, Monks. You must not cling to any *dhammas*.""  What are these *dhammas*? They are everything; there isn't anything which is not *dhamma*. Love and hate are *dhammas*, happiness and suffering are *dhammas*, like and dislike are *dhammas*; all of these things, no matter how insignificant, are *dhammas*. When we practice the Dhamma, when we understand, then we can let go. And thus we can comply with the Buddha's teaching of not clinging to any *dhammas*.

>All conditions that are born in our heart, all conditions of our mind, all conditions of our body, are always in a state of change. The Buddha taught not to cling to any of them. He taught his disciples to practice in order to detach from all conditions and not to practice in order to attain to any more.

>If we follow the teachings of the Buddha, then we are right. We are right but it is also troublesome. It's not that the teachings are troublesome, but it's our defilements which are troublesome. The defilements wrongly comprehended obstruct us and cause us trouble. There isn't really anything troublesome with following the Buddha's teaching. In fact we can say that clinging to the path of the Buddha doesn't bring suffering, because the path is simply ""let go"" of every single *dhamma*!

>For the ultimate in the practice of Buddhist meditation, the Buddha taught the practice of ""letting go."" Don't carry anything around! Detach! If you see goodness, let it go. If you see rightness, let it go. These words, ""let go,"" do not mean that we don't have to practice. It means that we have to practice following the method of ""letting go"" itself. The Buddha taught us to contemplate all *dhammas*, to develop the path through contemplating our own body and heart. The Dhamma isn't anywhere else. It's right here! Not someplace far away. It's right here in this very body and heart of ours.

>Therefore a meditator must practice with energy. Make the heart grander and brighter. Make it free and independent. Having done a good deed, don't carry it around in your heart, let it go. Having refrained from doing an evil deed, let it go. The Buddha taught us to live in the immediacy of the present, in the here and now. Don't lose yourself in the past or the future.

>The teaching that people least understand and which conflicts the most with their own opinions, is this teaching of ""letting go"" or ""working with an empty mind."" This way of talking is called ""Dhamma language."" When we conceive this in worldly terms, we become confused and think that we can do anything we want. It can be interpreted this way, but its real meaning is closer to this: It's as if we are carrying a heavy rock. After a while we begin to feel its weight but we don't know how to let it go. So we endure this heavy burden all the time. If someone tells us to throw it away, we say, ""If I throw it away, I won't have anything left!"" If told of all the benefits to be gained from throwing it away, we wouldn't believe them but would keep thinking, ""If I throw it away, I will have nothing!"" So we keep on carrying this heavy rock until we become so weak and exhausted that we can no longer endure, then we drop it.

>Having dropped it, we suddenly experience the benefits of letting go. We immediately feel better and lighter and we know for ourselves how much of a burden carrying a rock can be. Before we let go of the rock, we couldn't possibly know the benefits of letting go. So if someone tells us to let go, an unenlightened man wouldn't see the purpose of it. He would just blindly clutch at the rock and refuse to let go until it became so unbearably heavy that he just had to let go. Then he can feel for himself the lightness and relief and thus know for himself the benefits of letting go. Later on we may start carrying burdens again, but now we know what the results will be, so we can now let go more easily. This understanding that it's useless to carry burdens around and that letting go brings ease and lightness is an example of knowing ourselves.

>Our pride, our sense of self that we depend on, is the same as that heavy rock. Like that rock, if we think about letting go of self-conceit, we are afraid that without it, there would be nothing left. But when we can finally let it go, we realize for ourselves the ease and comfort of not clinging.

>In the training of the heart, you mustn't cling to either praise or blame. To just want praise and not to want blame is the way of the world. The Way of the Buddha is to accept praise when it is appropriate and to accept blame when it is appropriate. For example, in raising a child it's very good not to just scold all the time. Some people scold too much. A wise person knows the proper time to scold and the proper time to praise. Our heart is the same. Use intelligence to know the heart. Use skill in taking care of your heart. Then you will be one who is clever in the training of the heart. And when the heart is skilled, it can rid us of our suffering. Suffering exists right here in our hearts. It's always complicating things, creating and making the heart heavy. It's born here. It also dies here.

>The way of the heart is like this. Sometimes there are good thoughts, sometimes there are bad thoughts. The heart is deceitful. Don't trust it! Instead look straight at the conditions of the heart itself. Accept them as they are. They're just as they are. Whether it's good or evil or whatever, that's the way it is. If you don't grab hold of these conditions, then they don't become anything more or less than what they already are. If we grab hold we'll get bitten and will then suffer.

>With ""right view"" there's only peace. *Samādhi* is born and wisdom takes over. Wherever you may sit or lie down, there is peace. There is peace everywhere, no matter where you may go.

>So today you have brought your disciples here to listen to the Dhamma. You may understand some of it, some of it you may not. In order for you to understand more easily, I've talked about the practice of meditation. Whether you think it is right or not, you should take and contemplate it.

>As a teacher myself, I've been in a similar predicament. I, too, have longed to listen to Dhamma talks because, wherever I went, I was giving talks to others but never had a chance to listen. So, at this time, you really appreciate listening to a talk from a teacher. Time passes by so quickly when you're sitting and listening quietly. You're hungry for Dhamma so you really want to listen. At first, giving talks to others is a pleasure, but after awhile, the pleasure is gone. You feel bored and tired. Then you want to listen. So when you listen to a talk from a teacher, you feel much inspiration and you understand easily. When you are getting old and there's hunger for Dhamma, its flavor is especially delicious.

>Being a teacher of others you are an example to them, you're a model for other *bhikkhus*. You're an example to your disciples. You're an example to everybody, so don't forget yourself. But don't think about yourself either. If such thoughts do arise, get rid of them. If you do this then you will be one who knows himself.

>There are a million ways to practice Dhamma. There's no end to the things that can be said about meditation. There are so many things that can make us doubt. Just keep sweeping them out, then there's no more doubt! When we have right understanding like this, no matter where we sit or walk, there is peace and ease. Wherever we may meditate, that's the place you bring your awareness. Don't hold that one only meditates while sitting or walking. Everything and everywhere is our practice. There's awareness all the time. There is mindfulness all the time. We can see birth and death of mind and body all the time and we don't let it clutter our hearts. Let it go constantly. If love comes, let it go back to its home. If greed comes, let it go home. If anger comes, let it go home. Follow them! Where do they live? Then escort them there. Don't keep anything. If you practice like this then you are like an empty house. Or, explained another way, this is an empty heart, a heart empty and free of all evil. We call it an ""empty heart,"" but it isn't empty as if there was nothing, it's empty of evil but filled with wisdom. Then whatever you do, you'll do with wisdom. You'll think with wisdom. You'll eat with wisdom. There will only be wisdom.

>This is the teaching for today and I offer it to you. I've recorded it on tape. If listening to Dhamma makes your heart at peace, that's good enough. You don't need to remember anything. Some may not believe this. If we make our heart peaceful and just listen, letting it pass by but contemplating continuously like this, then we're like a tape recorder. After some time when we turn on, everything is there. Have no fear that there won't be anything. As soon as you turn on your tape recorder, everything is there.

>I wish to offer this to every *bhikkhu* and to everyone. Some of you probably know only a little Thai, but that doesn't matter. May you learn the language of the Dhamma. That's good enough!

My gratitude to u/dehont for alerting me to the existence of this treasure of a talk.  I hope you all enjoy it and benefit from it as well.

“When an aspirant is about to be born in that land through dedicated and undaunted practices, Tathāgata Amitāyus arrives together with Avalokiteśvara, Mahāsthāmaprāpta, innumerable transformed buddhas, a great assembly of a hundred thousand monks and śrāvakas, and innumerable devas in seven-jeweled palaces. Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, carrying a vajra seat, together with Bodhisattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta, approaches the aspirant.

Amitāyus releases a great flood of light that illuminates the aspirant’s body and, along with the bodhisattvas, extends his hands in welcome. Avalokiteśvara and Mahāsthāmaprāpta, together with innumerable bodhisattvas, praise and encourage the aspirant. 

Seeing this, the aspirant rejoices so greatly as to dance. Then he sees himself sitting on the vajra seat, and, following the Buddha, is born into that land in the time it takes to snap one’s fingers.”

I have been a practicing Buddhist for 5 years. My introduction to Buddhism was Theravadin and Vipassana meditation. My first teacher was a fairly prominent Zen Roshi of the mixed Rinzai/Soto lineage. I’ve also had a teacher in the Sri Lankan Theravadin tradition. I’ve been a very devoted student and have read more texts than anyone I’ve met in person, spanning most traditions of Buddhism with particular emphasis on early Buddhism, Chan, and Dzogchen.

I feel part of my problem is I read too much, not in lieu of practice as though as I am a daily meditator. My problem is I cannot stick to a particular tradition.

During times of great suffering I read early Buddhist scriptures and meditate up to 2 hours a day, sometimes experiencing the first Jhana. This greatly relieves acute suffering. But often I’m left hyperconcentrated, a bit cold, socially off putting and judgmental. Weaving in Metta practice doesn’t seem to help. I begin judging others for heedlessly following their desires. This is far from my normal personality.

This often leads to me going back to Dzogchen nonmeditation and enjoying uncontrived and beautifully creative non-duality. Reading Dzogchen poetry disabuses me of my judgments of others and suffuses me with love, kindness and gentleness. But unfortunately, due to a seemingly lack of focus on discipline (unlike early Buddhist scriptures) I end up falling into bad habits leading to suffering.

Sometimes Chan also is in involved as an intermediary between early Buddhism and Dzogchen.

I’ll dive into some lingering questions I have that I hope could be cleared up somehow.

How can we “know” for a fact how karma works, and that it works as Buddhism says it does? A little philosophical here, but what separates belief in karma and rebirth from knowledge of it? 

Is it supposed to be something we can measurably investigate for ourselves like a phenomenon in science? Are we supposed to just take it at face value and believe what we’re taught about karma and rebirth without really understanding the underlying mechanisms in the observable world, or is there a different approach altogether that can ascertain its place in reality?

The reason I’m confused is because I read an account like [this](https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) from SuttaCentral on how there were Buddhas as early as  91 eons ago, or 91 billion years ago, while we only know the universe to be 13.8 billion years old. Either there were previous universes somehow (how would anyone know about that independently anyway?), or there’s a difference in how time is understood here, and I just don’t get how this is supposed to be consistent with the extent of human knowledge so far. 

I appreciate any insights into this, and how it all comes together. I’ve read that there are criticisms of Ian Stevenson’s work on reincarnation, and how while it’s promising, there may have been issues with the methods he used to “prove” that remembering past lives is possible, and I’m not sure what to make of it either.

Despite being raised in luxury, he became deeply troubled by the suffering and impermanence he witnessed in the world. Determined to find a solution to the human condition, he renounced his princely life and set out on a spiritual quest.

After years of seeking enlightenment through various ascetic practices and meditation techniques, Siddhartha realized that extreme self-mortification was not the path to liberation. Self-mortification involves denying oneself bodily comforts and basic needs in the belief that it will lead to spiritual purification. However, Siddhartha found these harsh practices only weakened his body and mind. Instead, he decided to follow a middle way, a balanced approach between indulgence and asceticism.

One day, Siddhartha sat down under a bodhi tree, also known as the tree of enlightenment, in what is now Bodh Gaya, India. He made a firm resolution: he would not rise from meditation until he had attained enlightenment or died in the attempt.

As Siddhartha meditated deeply under the bodhi tree, he faced numerous internal and external challenges. According to legend, Mara, the personification of desire, delusion, and death, attempted to disturb Siddhartha's meditation in order to prevent him from attaining enlightenment. Mara sent his armies of demons to distract Siddhartha with illusions, temptations, and threats.

Despite Mara's efforts, Siddhartha remained steadfast in his meditation. He used his inner strength and wisdom to resist Mara's distractions. At one point, Mara challenged Siddhartha's right to sit beneath the tree, claiming that he, Mara, was the rightful owner of the seat. In response, Siddhartha touched the earth with his hand, calling upon the Earth as witness to his countless lifetimes of virtuous deeds and his readiness to attain enlightenment. The Earth shook, affirming Siddhartha's determination.

Finally, as the morning star rose in the sky, Siddhartha Gautama entered into deep meditation. He experienced profound insights into the nature of existence, the causes of suffering, and the path to liberation. In that moment of clarity, he became the Buddha, the Awakened One.

The Buddha's enlightenment brought him a deep understanding of the Four Noble Truths: the truth of suffering, the truth of the origin of suffering, the truth of the cessation of suffering, and the truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering. He also realized the concept of dependent origination, which explains how suffering arises due to interconnected causes and conditions.

His teachings formed the foundation of Buddhism, a spiritual tradition that has spread throughout the world, inspiring countless people to seek wisdom, compassion, and inner peace.",False,"I'm a Christian, currently rigorously studying the teachings of Jesus, but I find the Awakening of the Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, to be very inspiring.

“Mendicants, there are these four yokes. What four? The yokes of sensual pleasures, future lives, views, and ignorance.

And what is the yoke of sensual pleasures? It’s when you don’t truly understand sensual pleasures’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape. So greed, relishing, affection, infatuation, thirst, passion, attachment, and craving for sensual pleasures linger on inside. This is called the yoke of sensual pleasures. Such is the yoke of sensual pleasures.

And what is the yoke of future lives? It’s when you don’t truly understand future lives’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape. So greed, relishing, affection, infatuation, thirst, passion, attachment, and craving for continued existence linger on inside. This is called the yoke of future lives. Such are the yokes of sensual pleasures and future lives. 

And what is the yoke of views? It’s when you don’t truly understand views’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape. So greed, relishing, affection, infatuation, thirst, passion, attachment, and craving for views linger on inside. This is called the yoke of views. Such are the yokes of sensual pleasures, future lives, and views.

And what is the yoke of ignorance? It’s when you don’t truly understand the six fields of contact’s origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape, so ignorance and unknowing of the six fields of contact linger on inside. This is called the yoke of ignorance. Such are the yokes of sensual pleasures, future lives, views, and ignorance. These are bad, unskillful qualities that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death. That’s why someone yoked to them is called: ‘one who has not found sanctuary from the yoke’.

These are the four yokes.

There are these four kinds of unyoking. What four? Unyoking from sensual pleasures, future lives, views, and ignorance.

That’s why someone unyoked from them is called: ‘one who has found sanctuary from the yoke’.

These are the four kinds of unyoking. 
    
    Yoked to both sensual pleasures 
    and the desire to be reborn in a future life; 
    yoked also to views, and governed by ignorance,
    
    sentient beings continue to transmigrate, 
    with ongoing birth and death. 
    But those who fully understand sensual pleasures, 
    and the yoke to all future lives;
    
    with the yoke of views eradicated, 
    and ignorance dispelled, 
    unyoked from all yokes, 
    truly those sages have slipped their yoke.”

> “Whatever exists therein of material form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, he sees those states as impermanent, as suffering, as a disease, as a tumour, as a barb, as a calamity, as an affliction, as alien, as disintegrating, as void, as not self. **He turns his mind away from those states and directs it towards the deathless element thus: ‘This is the peaceful, this is the sublime, that is, the stilling of all formations, the relinquishing of all attachments, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibbāna.’** If he is steady in that, he attains the destruction of the taints. But if he does not attain the destruction of the taints because of that desire for the Dhamma, that delight in the Dhamma, then with the destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes one due to reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and there attain final Nibbāna without ever returning from that world. This is the path, the way to the abandoning of the five lower fetters. https://suttacentral.net/mn64/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false

The controversy here is in what exactly this directing of mind to the deathless describes.

I will show what the texts say and summarize

>“This, bhikkhu, is a designation for the element of Nibbāna: the removal of lust, the removal of hatred, the removal of delusion. The destruction of the taints is spoken of in that way.” https://suttacentral.net/sn45.7/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false

This is the general designation of the term nibbana (lit. Extinguishment)
> “Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu is ***percipient* thus: ‘This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, the stilling of all activities, the relinquishing of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, nibbāna.’* It is in this way, Ānanda, that a bhikkhu could obtain such a state of concentration that he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth; of water in relation to water; of fire in relation to fire; of air in relation to air; of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space; of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness; of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness; of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; of this world in relation to this world; of the other world in relation to the other world, but he would still be percipient.” https://suttacentral.net/an10.6/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false

Here it is described as a samadhi-perception not dependent on this world or another.

>“On one occasion, friend Ānanda, I was dwelling right here in Sāvatthī in the Blind Men’s Grove. There I attained such a state of concentration that I was not percipient of earth in relation to earth; of water in relation to water; of fire in relation to fire; of air in relation to air; of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space; of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness; of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness; of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; of this world in relation to this world; of the other world in relation to the other world, but I was still percipient.”
>
> “But of what was the Venerable Sāriputta percipient on that occasion?”
>
> **“One perception arose and another perception ceased in me: ‘The cessation of existence is nibbāna; the cessation of existence is nibbāna.’** Just as, when a fire of twigs is burning, one flame arises and another flame ceases, so one perception arose and another perception ceased in me: ‘The cessation of existence is nibbāna; the cessation of existence is nibbāna.’ On that occasion, friend, I was percipient: ‘The cessation of existence is nibbāna.’” https://suttacentral.net/an10.7/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false

Here it is also described as a samadhi-perception apprehended as ‘The cessation of existence is nibbāna; the cessation of existence is nibbāna

The question is then 'by practicing what special samadhi are the taints removed?'

The sutta are explicit

> these three unskilled states disappear utterly in him whose heart is well established in the four foundations of mindfulness, or who practices concentration on the signless https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.080.wlsh.html

Satipathana (four foundations of mindfulness) develops the path and the culmination of it's development is associated with a direct experience of nirodha (lit. cessation) as the Third Noble Truth and a removal of taints.

>""Vision arose, insight arose, discernment arose, knowledge arose, illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before: 'This is the noble truth of the cessation of stress'... 'This noble truth of the cessation of stress is to be directly experienced'... **'This noble truth of the cessation of stress has been directly experienced.'**
https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn56/sn56.011.than.html

Now what is signless samadhi? This has to be explained as sannavedaniyanirodha (cessation of perception & feeling)

> ""When a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception & feeling, three contacts make contact: contact with emptiness, contact with the signless, & contact with the undirected.""[3]
>
> ""Very good, venerable sir."" And, delighting in and approving of Ven. Kamabhu's answer, Citta asked him a further question: ""When a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception & feeling, to what does his mind lean, to what does it tend, to what does it incline?""
>
> ""When a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception & feeling, his mind leans to seclusion, tends to seclusion, inclines to seclusion.""[4] https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn41/sn41.006.than.html

Ven. Thanissaro's notes 

> Emptiness, the signless, & the undirected are names for a state of concentration that lies on the threshold of Nibbana. They differ only in how they are approached. According to the commentary, they color one's first apprehension of Nibbana: a meditator who has been focusing on the theme of inconstancy will first apprehend Nibbana as signless; one who has been focusing on the theme of stress will first apprehend it as undirected; one who has been focusing on the theme of not-self will first apprehend it as emptiness.[4](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn41/sn41.006.than.html#fnt-4). 

> According to the commentary, ""seclusion"" here stands for Nibbana. On emerging from the cessation of perception & feeling, and having had contact with emptiness/the signless/the undirected, the mind inclines naturally to a direct experience of Nibbana.

I won't comment on the commentary.

It's attainment is explained here

> [1] [The Ven. Moggallaana has described how, with the aid of the Buddha, **he has passed through all the jhaanas[2] right up to the ""sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception**.""]

> ""Then, friends, I thought: 'The signless concentration of the heart, the signless concentration of the heart, they say — now what is that?'

> ""Then I thought: 'In this a monk, paying no attention to any distinguishing signs,[3] enters on and dwells in that concentration of the heart which is without signs. This is called ""The signless concentration of heart.""'

> ""Then, friends, paying no attention to any distinguishing signs, I entered on and dwelt in that concentration of the heart which is without signs. But as I dwelt thus,[4] the consciousness-conforming-to-signs arose.[5]

> ""And then, friends, the Blessed One came to me by his powers[6] and said: 'Moggallaana, Moggallaana, Brahman,[7] do not slacken off in the signless concentration, make your mind steady, make the mind one-pointed, concentrate your mind in the signless concentration!'

> ""And after that, friends, paying no attention to any distinguishing signs, I entered on and dwelt in the signless concentration of the heart.

> ""Now, friends, if anyone were to truly declare: 'Through the Teacher's compassion the disciple gained great super-knowledge,'[8] he could rightly declare this of me.""
https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn40/sn40.009.wlsh.html

Note that that there are only 9 principial meditative attainment classifications in the suttas
The four classes of rupa (lit. form) jhana 
The four classes of formless percipience
Cessation of perception & feeling as the 9th.

At last the proposition that cessation of perception and feeling removes defilement is tied to this common phrase 

> **Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements come to an end.** To this extent the Buddha said that extinguishment is apparent in the present life in a definitive sense.”
https://suttacentral.net/an9.47/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin

One should draw out here that removal of taints occurs for one who transcends the feeling states in attaining cessation of perception & feeling. But it can not be drawn out that attaining formless percipience is necessary to attain sannavedaniyanirodha because the pannavimutti (released by wisdom) arahants don't have the formless attainments but have nevertheless removed the taints.

It follows that the pannavimutti arahants, also, go totally beyond all feeling states, including the unattained dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, they enter and remain in the cessation of perception & feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements come to an end. 

And so the direct experience of cessation of the aggregates, which is the 3rd noble truth & a removal of taints, is thus tied to sannavedaniyanirodha as signless samadhi.

Now the question is then

In dependence on what is he in such samadhi? As is pondered here

> When this was said, Ven. Sandha said to the Blessed One, ""But in what way, lord, is the excellent thoroughbred of a man absorbed when he is absorbed dependent neither on earth, liquid, heat, wind, the sphere of the infinitude of space, the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness, the sphere of nothingness, the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception, this world, the next world, nor on whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, or pondered by the intellect — and yet he is absorbed, so that to this excellent thoroughbred of a man, absorbed in this way, the gods, together with Indra, the Brahmas, & Pajapati, pay homage even from afar:
> 
> 'Homage to you, O thoroughbred man. Homage to you, O superlative man — you of whom we don't know even what it is 	dependent on which 	you're absorbed.'"" 

> ""There is the case, Sandha, where for an excellent thoroughbred of a man the perception[2] of earth with regard to earth has ceased to exist; the perception of liquid with regard to liquid... the perception of fire with regard to fire... the perception of wind with regard to wind... the perception of the sphere of the infinitude of space with regard to the sphere of the infinitude of space... the perception of the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness with regard to the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness... the perception of the sphere of nothingness with regard to the sphere of nothingness... the perception of the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception with regard to the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception... the perception of this world with regard to this world... the next world with regard to the next world... and whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, or pondered by the intellect: **the perception of that has ceased to exist**.

> ""Absorbed in this way, the excellent thoroughbred of a man is absorbed dependent neither on earth, liquid, fire, wind, the sphere of the infinitude of space, the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness, the sphere of nothingness, the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception, this world, the next world, nor on whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, or pondered by the intellect — and yet he is absorbed. And to this excellent thoroughbred of a man, absorbed in this way, the gods, together with Indra, the Brahmas, & Pajapati, pay homage even from afar:

> 'Homage to you, O thoroughbred man. Homage to you, O superlative man — you of whom we don't know even what it is 	dependent on which you're absorbed.'"" https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an11/an11.010.than.html

In summary he is absorbed **in dependence on the principial cessation** of all that other stuff.

This ties to 

> There is that ayatana, monks, where there is neither earth, nor water, nor fire, nor wind; neither dimension of the infinitude of space, nor dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, nor dimension of nothingness, nor dimension of neither perception nor non-perception; neither this world, nor the next world, nor sun, nor moon. And there, I say, there is neither coming, nor going, nor staying; neither passing away nor arising: unestablished,[1] unevolving, without support [mental object].[2] This, just this, is the end of dukkha. https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/ud/ud.8.01.than.html

This ayatana is the end of dukkha (lit. suffering).

Ayatana can translate as 'base', 'opportunity', 'reality', 'dimension', or 'possibility', etc

One should ask what does the term asankhata (lit: unmade or unfabricated) have to do with any of this?

The term asankhata is used to literally answer what makes cessation of dukkha possible

> There is, monks, an unborn[1] — unbecome — unmade — unfabricated. If there were not that unborn — unbecome — unmade — unfabricated, there would not be the case that escape from the born — become — made — fabricated would be discerned. But precisely because there is an unborn — unbecome — unmade — unfabricated, escape from the born — become — made — fabricated is discerned.[2] https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/ud/ud.8.03.than.html

> Monks, these three are fabricated characteristics of what is fabricated. Which three? Arising is discernible, passing away is discernible, alteration (literally, other-ness) while staying is discernible.
> 
> ""These are three fabricated characteristics of what is fabricated.
>
>""Now these three are unfabricated characteristics of what is unfabricated. Which three? No arising is discernible, no passing away is discernible, no alteration while staying is discernible.
>
> ""These are three unfabricated characteristics of what is unfabricated."" https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.047.than.html

There is a theravadin commentary to the Udana texts, by Dhammapala, called Udanatthakatha

>... at the same point therein also the absence of this world and the next world, he therefore says ""Neither this world nor the next world"". 

> This is it's meaning:

> Thererein there is neither of the two, viz. That world of the khandas that has acquired the designation ""This world belonging to those seen conditions, this state of affairs"" and that world of the khandas that has acquired the designation ""The future state, that which is other than, subsequent to, that"".

> *Nor both sun and moon* means that since it is possible to speak of the gloom and of a need for that gloom's scattering to be maintained by sun and moon (only) when there be something that has taken form - so whence the gloom, or a sun & moon scattering that gloom, wherein simply nothing at all has taken form - therefore there is therein, in that nibbana, neither viz. sun and moon; in this way he indicates the fact of nibbana having it's own nature solely that of light.

> And as the Dhamma-king was explaining to those lacking complete penetration, the ultra-profound,  extremely hard to see, abstruse and subtle, Deathless nibbana, that is beyond the sphere of logic, perpetually calm, capable of being experienced only by the wise, extremely choice (yet) not formerly experienced (by them), even in a dream, within this samsara that is without beginning, he, having, thus far, first of all dispelled their lack of knowledge and so on to it's existence, saying ""There is, monks, that base"", then explains that (same nibbana) via elimination of things that are other than that saying ""Wherein there is neither earth... nor both sun and moon"", whereby there is elucidated the fact that that which is the unconditioned element, which has as it's own nature that which is the antithesis of all conditioned things, such as earth and so forth, is nibbana, for which (same) reason he (next) says  ""There, too, monks, I do not speak neither of coming (and so forth)"".

The commentator makes a reference to

These thoughts can serve as distractions and obstacles to deeper mindfulness and insight. Practitioners may also experience troubling or negative thoughts during meditation, which can be challenging to navigate. Here’s how a practitioner can approach these thoughts from a Buddhist perspective, emphasizing that the process is not about suppressing emotions. Throughout this explanation, I will reference Buddhist texts that discuss this topic:

**Awareness and Observation**: The first step in meditation is to become aware of all thoughts that arise, including desires, delusions, illusions, temptations, and troubling thoughts. Observing thoughts without judgment is crucial. Recognize and acknowledge them without attachment. This approach is rooted in the Satipatthana Sutta, which teaches practitioners to observe their mental states with mindfulness and non-attachment.

**Non-attachment**: In Buddhism, the key to dealing with all thoughts is to avoid attachment to them. Understand that thoughts are transient and do not define you. Allow them to come and go without clinging to them or trying to resist them. This teaching is found in the Dhammapada (verses 277-278), where the Buddha emphasizes the impermanent nature of all phenomena.

**Mindfulness**: Mindfulness is about being present in the moment. When thoughts arise, acknowledge them without becoming entangled in them. Return your focus to your meditation object, such as your breath, sound, or a mantra. The Buddha teaches the practice of mindfulness in the Anapanasati Sutta, where he guides practitioners to focus on their breath to cultivate mindfulness.

**Investigation and Reflection**: When certain thoughts or feelings persist, use the opportunity to investigate them. Reflect on their nature, origin, and potential outcomes. Understanding the impermanent and unsatisfactory nature of thoughts can help you let go of them. This practice aligns with the Abhidhamma teachings, which emphasize understanding the nature of mental formations.

**Equanimity**: Maintain equanimity when confronting any kind of thought. Understand that thoughts are a natural part of the human mind and are neither inherently good nor bad. By not reacting strongly to them, you can maintain focus and calmness. This equanimity is taught in the Karaniya Metta Sutta, where the Buddha advises cultivating a mind of loving-kindness and equanimity.

**Use the Thoughts as Practice**: Rather than seeing these thoughts as distractions, view them as opportunities for practice. They are part of the process of understanding your mind and deepening your meditation. The Buddha encourages this approach in the Kalama Sutta, advising practitioners to test teachings and insights through their own experience.

**Patience and Compassion**: Meditation requires patience and self-compassion. Recognize that it is natural for the mind to wander and for various thoughts to arise. Be gentle with yourself and understand that developing mindfulness takes time and practice. This approach is supported by the teachings in the Itivuttaka, where the Buddha emphasizes the importance of patience and loving-kindness.

**Redirect Attention**: When you notice that you are becoming caught up in a thought, gently redirect your attention back to your meditation object. This practice helps train your mind to stay focused. This is a central teaching in the Anapanasati Sutta, where the Buddha emphasizes focusing on the breath to develop concentration.

**Developing Insight**: As you progress in your meditation practice, you will gain insight into the nature of thoughts and mental formations. This understanding can help you cultivate detachment and reduce the impact of these thoughts on your practice. This aligns with the teachings in the Sutta Nipata, where the Buddha discusses the cultivation of wisdom and insight.

**Dealing with Troubling Thoughts**: If you encounter thoughts that feel troubling or negative, observe them without judgment and recognize them as products of the mind. Instead of trying to suppress them, allow them to arise naturally and pass away in their own time. Redirect your attention back to your meditation practice. This approach is consistent with the Buddha’s teaching in the Majjhima Nikaya, where he advises letting go of unwholesome thoughts and returning to the focus of meditation.

The practice of meditation is not about suppressing emotions or thoughts. Instead, it is about observing them and understanding their transient nature. By accepting and acknowledging these thoughts without judgment, you can develop greater awareness and insight, and maintain a sense of equanimity and presence in your meditation practice.",False,"Hello, I am new to Buddhist teachings, and want to begin meditation soon to understand myself and my desires and temptations better.

I no longer identify as a Christian, and I no longer see any reason to believe in demons, but in a reduced way the fear of demons and demonic possession has stayed, and this idea about demons influencing other creeds and their followers has stuck around too.

I'm new to this sub (and to spirituality in general), but I have a question.

Today I finally watched Seven Years in Tibet, and although I thoroughly loved this movie and the emotional and mental journey of Heinrich Harrer in this- the information during the credits left me heartbroken.

Apparently 6.000 monasteries were destroyed in China's 'laying claim' to Tibet, and more than a million Tibetans died. 

Although lives lost can't be retrieved, unless one believes in reincarnation (which I personally don't). But to have all these monasteries from a peaceful civilisation destroyed, just did not sit right with me. 

Among questions of 'why?' and instinctual feelings of anger, I also felt compelled to find out what happened and maybe even help rebuilding them if that's still ongoing today.

Problem is: I couldn't find any information on this. And I'm hoping that, by asking this here, there's someone who can tell me more.

Before this I was a heavy porn addict and masturbated frequently. Nobody around me educated me about the destructive effects of porn, rather they all acted as if it was a ""normal thing to do"" even though we were all a religious family. With absolutely no restraint whatsoever,  I was plunged into this depraved world which has no limit whatsoever. I turned into a lusty animal that always sought sex pleasure and looked at every female with lusty eyes. This completely destroyed my conscience and affected my self-esteem, mental health (I went on psych meds for a full year) and academic life. I failed multiple years of college and am now left struggling to get a job. (Porn is still present in my life now, although in much smaller amounts).

Porn has made me think and do some bad things which I cannot really describe here. One deed in particular stands out and has given me a lot of pain after I resolved to set myself straight. It is a very strange kind of sin. It is depraved, indeed, but yet no one was hurt. (I have never really physically hurt anybody in my life save some petty quarrels in childhood, where I only grabbed the offender by the collar). This deed was done in complete secrecy, so no one other than me (and the Buddha in me of course) knows about this. If I were to confess this to someone, it might create unnecessary conflict. No scripture speaks of this kind of a deed (how I wish the teachings were a little more elaborate to accommodate the trillions of new/creative sins committed by humans on a regular basis). I recognize what I did was wrong but have no idea as to how wrong it was and what kind of punishment I might get for this in the hellish realms (I know I am going there for sure).

Thoughts of this deed and the resulting guilt torment me on a daily basis, sucking away all the energy I need to set myself straight, work on getting a job and live a righteous life. I just don't know how much bad karma I have created with that deed and if at all I can be saved. While going through the Dhammapada, I came across this teaching:

""Neither in the sky nor in mid-ocean, nor by entering into mountain clefts, nowhere in the world is there a place where one may escape from the results of evil deeds.""

This is rather scary. More so in my situation as I do not even know the nature of the consequences because I don't know the seriousness of the deed. There would be a little peace if atleast I knew what to expect, no matter how gory it is.

Advice please.

It seems that their is a certain spiritual privilege that men in Buddhism have that women don’t. Women can become Arahants and enlightened beings in Theravada Buddhism, there are even female Bodhisattvas in the Mahayana and Vajrayana tradition, but the actual Buddha can never be a woman depending on who you ask and what you read or interpret in the canons. Though reaching Nirvana is incredibly difficult for everyone, it seems to be more challenging for women and that seems unfair to me. Maybe I am looking at this from a western point of view but I want to be able to understand and rationalize why things are laid out this way. Is this actual Dharma teaching this or is this just social norms influencing tradition? 

I’ve also realized that I may be missing the forest for the trees and giving gender too much consideration. Focusing on gender may actually be counter to the point of the Dharma and enlightenment as gender is not an intrinsic part of being and the Buddha was probably a woman in his past lives.

- If reincarnation exists how were we all created?

- Why do we worship Buddha if he isn’t a god?

- Will Nirvana be like heaven? 

- If I don’t listen to Buddha will I go to hell?

- Do I need faith in karma or rebirth to be Buddhist?

All of these questions are grounded in a preexisting assumption. First, supposing that we were created with nothing before it. Second, supposing only gods are worshipped. Third, supposing heaven is the ultimate achievement. Fourth, supposing hell is the ultimate punishment. Fifth, supposing practice and faith are separate.

All of these questions come from a perspective very familiar with Christianity or God-worship. Creationism, not worshipping anything except God, getting rewarded with heaven, getting punished with hell, and having blind faith vs good works.

All of these perspectives, while great for Christianity, will lead to confusion if you assume them to be true in Buddhism.

If you really want to understand the Buddha’s teachings, to enter the dharma door of Buddhism, you’ll need to leave these Christian ideas at the door.

Explore reincarnation without assuming a single beginning. Investigate what worship really is without associating it with gods. Study nirvana in relation to curing the ills of samsara rather than achieving a reward from a god. Learn about hell realms not as prisons you’re sentenced to but as the results of your karmic actions. Understand that faith is not always blind, nor is any practice without faith.

Go into Buddhism with an open mind ready to learn, absorb, and advance in this wondrous dharma the Buddha provided us. 

We are invited into his room. We are his guests. Best to explore it ourselves, with the Buddha as our host and guide, rather than be led by someone or something else in our exploration.

You will find so much joy in learning something new, instead of trying to recycle your existing views. Let go of the old views. See where that takes you on this new road.

I hope this helps anyone who is studying Buddhism and reaching roadblocks in their studies.

Like as a sustaining principle, sure, it makes sense, but it doesn't seem to get things off the ground to begin with. 

In Christian thought, God is the underlying foundation of all being, and this makes a lot of sense in terms of determining why/how anything exists at all.

I've read arguments against the necessity of a creator God like those of Vasubandhu, but found them to be unconvincing/misunderstanding what God is in the Christian view, and ultimately dismantled by Thomist defenses.

I’m fully aware this would break the fourth precept and I recently took refuge and along with that the five precepts I do have a hesitation to lie but I feel like I’m between a rock and a hard place.

The people didn't act like this before, apparently they were not prone to anger before as they are after the injury.

I waver between whether materialist science or Buddhism is true, and I feel like this is one point that weakens the Buddhist argument because it goes against Buddhist ideas of how things work as I understood it, and it wasn't mentioned that this happens anywhere as far as I learned Buddhism.

I think this is how Buddhists back would think if they found someone acting this way: The person did bad deeds in the future and got injured in this way, unless it was an accident. They are angry and hostile because that's how they were, and that is the karma they are cultivating now because that tendency returned, or they started acting this way in reaction to the pain or their circumstances.

The Buddhist explanation based on will action now or in the past makes no sense, or less sense than the scientific one:

People behave based on the physical processes in the brain, they emerged from matter and there is no relation to past actions in any past lives. When brain is physically damaged in the part that has to do with self control and judgement, the person becomes hostile and aggressive, and has trouble with self control.

It just does not fit the Buddhist narrative that self control, the propensity toward ill will and anger is something that is cultivated. Someone who was not angry often or hostile could become like that suddenly seemingly as a result of that injury. How do I reconcile this? Is this just one of those points in which Buddhism fails? Like how in other points it fails in being a religion that is the real one that explains reality and is the truth? Like how the Buddha took 7 steps as soon as he was born, and stuff like that?

I went online to find different materials to use for malas, I don't have a teacher yet so I better follow the teachings of Padmasambhava. It's suggested by that mala made of bodhi seed is a great mala for any activity but I found out that it's very expensive nowadays and it's much harder to trust which sellers as some of them can be a seed from a different species of tree rather than the bodhi trees. And then I wondered if I might buy a mala made of rudraksha beads as they are the type of material I prefer to use when I pass them through my fingers (they seem to have a rough texture so it's nicer to feel and grip on in my opinion.)

However, I found out that rudraksha are mostly used for wrathful practices rather than peaceful practices as Padmasambhava had written. I had to learn at first peaceful practices rather jumping into wrathful practices but I still would like to buy those types of beads not because they feel and look nice but also they are the most accessible and effective beads that I can find (like rudraksha beads can multiply the recitation of a mantra by 20 million, a ruby mala can multiply another by 100 million or a bodhi seed mala manifests all benefits from all practises.)

Still, I'm doubting if I should buy these beads or not. Am I disrespecting Buddhism for using the wrong type of mala is a specific practice?

Put down your hands. Okay. What do you want to ask? Today, we are going to ask you for advice on how to being mindful of the Buddha. Why do you have deep faith in this Buddha's name when you just studied Buddhism? Why can you chant this Buddha's name so well? Can you tell us the cause? From the incident of 3 soldiers at the land god temple. At that time, there was a pond. During the division confrontation exercise. Three soldiers accidentally drove a truck into the pond and were drown. They didn't know it was a pond and thought it was a road. At that time, I had been a vegetarian for 3 months. They came to me. When I was sleeping, I felt there were people. When I got up, I saw them and asked why you were in my house? The ghosts begged me to ferry them. I said: No way. I haven't been a vegetarian for long. How can I ferry you? He said: Yes you can. You are doing good deeds. I said: Don't bother me.

I ignored them and fell asleep. Back then, it was midnight. I slept until two in the morning. Then I woke up. They were still there waiting. I said: You haven't gone yet. They said: We beg for your mercy. We are in pain. Because after people die, they may not be cured of their illness unless someone ferries them or they did good things while they were alive. They kept begging me, saying they were suffering. This kind of ghost is the lowest, the heaviest karma, and the heaviest Yin qi. They are 5 feet tall, a foot off the ground. They walk like human but faster. On seeing that, people might think they are flying. In fact, they are not. If they go farther, they have to go to the station and take trains like us. Or find out if someone will travel there and take a ride. There is another ghost. Demonic Spirit is more terrific. It suck people's vitality. It is about 7 feet tall, thin and fast. He can be far away in a flash. If the vitality is sucked out, one feels weak. At the time, I had just finished my military service and was still eating meat.

It happened once I was doing template work and passing the cemetery, my vitality was sucked out. It was raining that day and he came during my lunch break. After he sucked out my vitality, I became too weak to move. I've seen 10 kinds of ghosts, this is most ferocious one. So it sucked out your qi. My qi was sucked. When I returned, my limbs were soft. All my vitality was gone. Those soldiers kept begging me to ferry them. I asked them how. He said they died at the land god temple, so we had to chant the Buddha there. I said: Ok, I will follow you there. I got up and became two persons, one was still sleeping, the other followed them to the temple like flying.

What to do now? They told me to sit under the tree and chant Buddha. Suddenly, a ghost came out the big tree. So before we Buddhists want to cut down a big tree, we have to burn incense and tell the ghosts hiding inside to move out beforehand so that they won't be caught by surprise. That tree is big, he came out suddenly, I said: You scared me by coming out so fast. I'm timid. He kept saying sorry. I said: That's ok. The ghost said: You chant Buddha, that's too slow. You bless us. I asked: How to bless? The three stood in a row. They wanted me to touch their heads. I chanted Amitabha, but they couldn't utter a word. I said: Why don't you chant? We have heavy karmic hindrance.

Then I told them to stand well again, and I exerted strength: Amitabha. My body radiated light, but the light couldn't enter his body and bounced back. Why is that? Then I came up with an ideal and told the ghost who scared me to block behind me. The three stood in a row as before. I said: You should chant together with me. Actually, they couldn't. Amitabha. After chanting, my body radiated light. The light bounced back and forth. The Buddha light entered their bodies successfully. Their bodies became golden, and they entered a golden ball. The ball floated in the air, and they said to me: Thanks. Our illness had been cured. We are going, thanks for uplifting and ferrying us. From then on, I have faith in chanting Buddha. After I abstain from eating meat 3 years, I started to learn Buddhism.

This is the first time I've got the inspiring experience. They fly into the air, I have no idea where they go but think they might be liberated. Even if they didn't go to the Blissful World, they might become celestials. Because they were ascending, I don't know where they go. I just became a vegetarian for 3 months. So you just ate vegetarian food and chanted Buddha for 3 months? No, I knew how to chant Buddha when I was in the third grade of elementary school. When I watched opera and puppet show, a monk came out and chanted Amitahba. I thought this Buddhist name sounds very nice.

I might be chanting Buddha in the past life but didn't get liberated at last. So I feel delighted on hearing the Buddha's name in this life. Therefore, we have to chant Buddha the more the better. Deeply focus on one door and recite the Buddha truthfully. Then you'll have deeper affinity with Amitabha. Though you are not reborn in the West in this life, you will be correspondent with Amitabha soon in the afterlife. The destined connection is very important. So we need to be mindful of the Buddha diligently.

Even if you are not reborn in the West in this life, you definitely will be reborn there in the future. I have deep faith in Amitabha. After learning Buddhism, I become healthy and devout. Why did I become healthy? One day when I was sleeping, came a 7-foot-tall Yakṣa ghost, but it is a good ghost. When I slept, I felt like someone was coming into my house. In an instant, he arrived at the door. He had supernatural powers. I couldn't move at all. He pointed at me while I was lying on the bed, and I floated. I was tasered by that ghost, trembling all over, and quickly chanted Amitabha. As a result, my whole body was glowing with light, my energy was stronger, and the light was spinning.

The Buddha light was so strong, and I felt amazed and didn't feel pain. After being tasered, I felt I gain more energy. He came like a gust of wind, but after all that he shrunk, like a frail hunchbacked old woman because he gave me all his energy. The Yakṣa gave you energy. He was not a Yakṣa but a good ghost. Yakṣa is a bad ghost but he is a good ghost. There are many kinds of ghosts. Then he continued to come every few days for three months. The last time he came, I was lying in the bed, but my soul was sitting in meditation in the air.

While sleeping, I felt that he was coming very far away. My soul jumped in the air and meditated, and the other was still sleeping on the bed. He came and acted the same to taser me. I observed his appearance carefully. I said: I'm here. Is your taser useful? You're more capable than me. I don't need to come anymore. It's as funny as a scene from a cartoon. Then he hasn't shown up for a long time. He came to help you. Yes, I think so, he came to give me energy. Half a year later, I did template work and was very tired. I said toward the void: Good brother bodhisattva, I work so tired today, can you came to taser me?

After saying that, I went to sleep, and he really came to taser me with the same action. I said: I felt comfortable with the taser. Thanks. He said: No problem. I will come if you need help. Then he returned. To replenish energy. Yes, you know doing template? It is a hard work. I hired 30 workers, but I also do it myself. All the money I earn is spent on inviting people to chant Buddha and recite sutra. I give 500 NTD to those who live far away, 400 to those who live nearby, 300 to the villagers, 250 to children. Back then, I have invited up to 25 people.

I've been doing this for 30 years. During the first 15 years, I gave less and mostly invited our villagers, and those who are alcoholic, retarded, and children, each for 250. Once, a family of 10 people got a total of 5,000 and asked if they could call more people. I said: Yes, you may call as many as you can because I earn more money at that time. The most I’ve given in one night is 12,000 (USD 400). We regularly practice together 3 times a week. Because I can't carry them all, I also invite a driver to help carry people, he chant Amitabha too. Drug addicts and alcoholics are relatively short-lived.

I care about them especially and hope that they can form a deep bond with Amitabha. If they don't show up, I'll make a special trip to pick them up. Did they really chant when they came? Yes, they would. But they came for money. I'd monitor and said to them: You have to chant because you've got paid. There was a group of drug addicts there, about a dozen people, and 5 or 6 of them took turns at one time. Sometimes, they are lazy and don't wanna come. There was also a group of alcoholics, 3 or 4 people came sometimes. There was a man addicted to drugs had injection on his left hand, the wound was rotten, dripping with fluid, and was stinky.

He wanted to borrow money from me. I'd lend him money if he borrowed 1,000. He asked to borrow 6,000, I dared not say you're gonna buy drug, but he showed me here. His left hand was seriously ill, liquid flowed out of pinholes and was stinky. So would his right hand. Seeing the symptom was serious, I agreed to his request and took him to the doctor. He had surgery and applied medicine, and I paid for all the expenses. A year later, he died of a drug overdose. Ate too much.

There was a young alcoholics whose father, uncles, and all the family love to drink alcohol. He looks normal, but is actually a retard. He couldn't find a job because he was dull. He was unable to understand your words. After his father and uncles died, he couldn't find alcohol to drink. He drank medical alcohol from the small plastic bottle, which cost 20.When his old sister saw that, she slapped him. He got alcohol poisoning. I was very concerned about him. Once I saw him drink a whole bottle after chanting. Soon after, he drank four bottles in one sitting. I didn't think he'd make it much longer.

I was especially concerned about him. If he didn't show up, I would go pick him. As a result, he also kicked the bucket within a year. There is a man in our village. He is also a drunkard, sometimes even going crazy. His parents and siblings ignored him. He has two sons studying in the elementary school. It's hard for him to make ends meet. His wife is retarded and lives in the care home. I told them: If the three of you came to chant, I would pay you 1,000, 3 night per week. You are also welcome to the one-day Buddhist chanting activities of every month. I would pay you 1,000 and your children 800, and they promised and were joyful. I also gave them red envelopes, 1,000 each on New Year. Plus a 0.6 kg pack of dried mushrooms. I started buying them at 600 and 1000 now.

I give the same gift and red envelope to all the 50s people chanting Buddha. They are very happy. There are 3 types of people who are more likely to be reborn in the Bliss World. First, it’s easy for people who are suffering to go. The 2nd one is that diligent people are easy to go. The 3rd one is... I don't remember (note: a simple and honest person). To go to the Blissful World, you ought to be mindful of the Buddha; See through and let go 看破和放下. There is a poem that moves me very much and is engraved in my heart: The realm of the Blissful World can lead you to attain nirvana. It may be difficult for you to be reborn there by just doing miscellaneous good deeds according to the circumstance.

Therefore, the Tathagata selects the essential Dharma and teaches people to focus on reciting Amitabha. This is the teaching by Master Shandao telling us to focus on chanting Buddha. The man I mentioned before died shortly after suffering from alcohol poisoning. I found out after 5 days. So I invited a few lay people to go to the Dajia Crematorium to help chanting. In the crematorium, everybody has their own home with a fridge. I lifted the white cloth and realized that people who were used to chanting Buddha were different. He was a simple and pure person. His complexion was smiley and bright. I think this man must go to either heaven or the land of Amitabha. Was it the first time you saw him after he died? That was the first time I saw him five days after he passed away. I said why he was so good-looking.

Therefore, those who suffer are more likely to be born in the Blissful World. Plus he was simple and pure, making him more likely to go there. He suffered and has simple and pure characters. Even though he was muddle-headed. His face was bright and smiley, which is a good sign. There is a laywoman of the same age as me who is very straightforward. I saw she has a lot of free time in her day, so I invited her to chant Buddha together. She cried. I asked: Why are you crying? She said: My husband brought a woman back, refused to let me stay and kicked me out. She is straightforward. I said: You are very leisurely. Why not come to chant Amitabha with us? Amitabha will solve the problem for you. She said: Is that so? I said: Yes. Because she is simple and pure, she promised. Since then she has chanted Buddha with us for 7 years.

One day, we went to pick her up, she kept crying and wouldn't get in. I said: Ahon, What's up? Why don't you get in? If you want to cry, get in and cry, we are late. After she got in, other women in the car asked her, but she ignored them. I asked: Why are you crying? She said: I don't have time to chant. I won't talk to you. Later I realized that she was saying farewell to us. She didn't come because she was admitted to the hospital, 3 days later, she was reborn. Then I brought forth the resolve to chant Buddha for her. I chant 12 hours every time. There are 700 families in our village. If somebody pass away, I will help with chanting Buddha when I have time.

I will go 5 to 8 times for each individual. Each time on a different day? Yeah. I would bring my pad and rosary beads at midnight. I used to recite the Diamond Sutra. I like to recite it very much because the words in the Diamond Sutra are easy, though it's hard to achieve. I'd have chance to achieve it if I understood. Recently, I focus on chanting Buddha. I lifted the white cloth and saw her face was bright and smiley. She is a simple, pure, and honest person. These kinds of people are easier to be reborn in the Bliss World. Do you help chanting in the evening when you have time? If I don't practice altogether in the evening, I would go to bed early at 9 pm.

and get up at 12 am sharp. Then I'd brush teeth, wash face, and went to the dead with my pad, meditate and chant Buddha. You go alone? I usually go alone. I go alone even if I don't know them. Sometimes fellow practitioners call me, I go with them. It's exciting to chant at the funeral home. Once I hired a guy and on his 3rd day on the job, before lunchtime, he accidentally fell while walking. A tool bumped his head, his eyes fell out and brain fluid leaked out. When the horrible accident happened, I sent him to the hospital immediately. The doctor advised not to save him. Even if he was saved, he might become a vegetable, and it is painful.

Even so, he only has two months to live.. I noticed his wife and son living in Tainan. They agreed with the doctor's advice and decided not to save him. Then they took his body to the morgue. The morgue of the Taichung Veteran General Hospital has two underground floors. Each floor has 30 fridges, a lot of bodies there. The 3 fridges are placed in a row. I sat in meditation beside the worker. When feeling tired or sleepy, I circled and chanted Buddha. There were 3 dead beside. There were more than 20 dead in the fridge opposite. I thought it was exciting. I had a solid foundation in the countryside, but I was still a little timid.

But I was not scared when thinking that I could rely on Amitabha. I was chanting like: Amitabha. Till 3 o'clock, I felt a little drowsy and wanted to drink a cup of coffee to cheer me up. Coffee is very useful to me. While I couldn't hold on anymore, I drank coffee. To what extent did I chant the Buddha? Because I was in the basement, I saw a whole bunch of ghosts, both adults and children gathered outside on the road. There were hundreds. I was very surprised to see a large group of them. When I was drinking coffee, they all rushed in. At that time. I chanted to the extent that the Buddha's light filled the road and ground making a whirring sound like a cafeteria gas stove turned up to maximum with a bright light, shining the good brothers and turning those bodies to golden. I knew they were asking for merits. I said: Wait a moment, after I finish this cup of coffee, I will dedicate the merit to you. After finishing it, I said: I will dedicate this merit to the beings, good brothers here, may you be reborn in the Bliss World and free from suffering of reincarnation. After the transference, all the good brothers were instantly flushed to the air by 3-floor high Buddha light, with the whirring sound. I am not scared at all. The Buddha light was as bright as flame, shiny and soft but not dazzling. The bodies of all the good brothers turned golden and rushed to the sky. Did you really see it? Yes, I saw the scene with my eyes open, I was not in the dream. This is my most exciting experience.

One week later, 7 good brothers brought his soul back. He used to practice at Ksitigarbha Temple in Puli. His bardo was about 2 feet tall. He wore colorful, beautiful and shiny clothes. When he showed up, because he had shrunk, and I couldn't recognize. I asked: Why are you in my house? He said: I'm Ahui. Ahui? The dead worker. It's you. He said: I'm sorry to cause you trouble and spent so much money. I said: That's ok. Don't mention it. Why didn't you go to Amitabha? He said that he practices Tantra. Even so, he has received the merit of chanting Buddha. That's his choice. The ordinary bardo is black, about 2-3 feet tall, thin and quick, can fly. Because he got merit, he dressed colorful clothes. The 7 good brothers are such big, 8 feet tall, quick and strong, with supernatural power, and they are good ghosts. After the conversation, they took him to Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva.

In the comment of that question everyone answered me that Buddhism don't have any gods and also talked about reincarnation due to our Karma. Now, here is another of my question regarding this topic. If, as Buddhism teaches, there is no personal God interacting with His creation, who determines whether or not a person has done something to merit either “good” or “bad” Karma? If this decision is made at the end of one’s life, who is actually making the decision? Who is the final judge of Karma? Like in Hinduism we have Lord Yama( the god of death) who passes judgment to the aatma about their Karma and decides whether he receives heaven or hell. How is this process done according to Buddhism?

There are many reasons why, and I do have people in my life who are very knowledgeable in it and I know a lot myself, and I choose this path and to take this journey to make a better version of myself.

As, I feel that this highschool year, I've been very mean and I haven't been really a good person to others. And I really do disgust myself with my own behavior that is influenced by other people, but ever since I've been trying to follow and partake in Buddhism I've been actually doing a bit better with myself.

After having long talks about the religion, It opened my eyes to apologize for past mistakes, to not think negatively and to learn to forgive. Also to try a lot of meditation that will help with my frustration and depression.

To get to the point, already things have been a lot better and I choose to now take this path in life, but I am a very unfiltered person and I often say things or do things I still don't realize was wrong in the moment and I immediately realize I shouldn't have said or did that.

Some of the answers were like: ""oh it's ok. You will forget them in the next life"" or ""they're gone. There's nothing you can do. If the thought that you'll meet them again makes you feel better, than keep believing it"". 

First of all, there are a few mentions in buddhist scriptures about people remembering their past lives (like the guy who was reborn as a deva and then came back again to Earth in deva form to communicate with someone he knew as a human. I vaguely remember this story).

Also there's no established doctrine in buddhism (as far as I know) that you will not meet your loved ones again in the next lives, in other forms. We're energy, and energy creates bounds. Many people had the experience of meeting again someone they knew in past lives, and even recognizing them by karmic circunstances. So i don't think it's that of a stretch.

We also don't know what exactly happens after Nirvana. Buddhism just describes it as ""freedom and ever lasting happiness"", and there's the chance we can possibly meet other awakened minds in this state, mingle with them, or even have communication with them in some form.

And honestly, what good are you doing by saying to someone who is having a hard time dealing with grief that they will never meet their loved ones again, just because that's your understanding of the buddhist theology? What good or compassion are you spreading by doing that? I think this is a very cold-hearted action, devoid of any empathy. Don't even have to mention the amount of negative karma these kind of words are generating for the ones who say them.

This is not the first time I saw this kind of behavior in this sub, and this makes me really sad. A lot of people here filled with pride, self righteousness, and acting with insensibility.

I have been on the path of understanding the dhamma and I am learning about the noble eightfold path. This includes skillful means of handling the arising of harmful thoughts and feelings before they manifest into harmful actions. So is this all necessary for awakening? Can one be an awakened mind but still be susceptible to human failings? Even if the things they are saying are truly wise and encourage skillful means, can they themselves still fall victim to their own unskillfulness?

I know this may be a point of contention for some, as there are some schools that say that morality is not a requirement for awakening, while other schools believe that morality is a requirement and a product of awakening.

I want to make it clear now that, if I say anything offensive, it’s not intentional and plz correct me, I only seek to understand.


I’ve asked this same question in Muslim and Catholic Subs so far (for their religions)

The reason is that, I’m Agnostic but I’m constantly questioning my faith in something bigger than myself and what I perceive and know. 

As apart of my self improvement, I’m always hungry for learning things. I’ve been trying to read more about things I love, Folklore, History, Culture, Religion, Philosophy 

I’m 21 So a quick background both spiritually and what I know about Buddhism  on me I’d say I was raised atheist, my Dad is Irish from Dublin and was raised Catholic, but because of the troubles and the horrible abuses he witnessed in the church, he’s pretty much rebuked  religion  as a whole he thinks it all bullshit. The only one ironically he has any respect for is Buddhism, but I wouldn’t consider him or he wouldn’t consider himself Buddhist.

My mom was raised kinda Baptist? She only ever went to church when living with my great grandmother 

So growing up I was atheist in middleschool and some of highschool I went through my agro atheist phase, but mellowed out by my senior year. What really got me questioning my faith was I got into a car accident I caused and it totaled my car.
I’m a big and tall guy, and I was directly hit on my drivers side by a large pickup  truck going 45mph (he slowed down obviously but the speed limit was 45)

I came out of that unscathed no bleeding not even any bruises and I’m a big guy I was driving and old Corolla like back when they were smaller.

That was Prolly 4 years ago and I’ve really questioned why the hell I came out unscathed. And really have questioned my own mortality and spirituality.


So my mom actually is the one who has the most experience with Buddhism (maybe?) she went to visit my Grandpa to meet his second family in Thailand, over a decade ago, and she was also thier for the water festival.

I don’t know if her step mom is a Buddhist I never asked I do know she’s at least like in touch with her culture, she’s spiritual or for a lack of a better word, superstitious.

Good luck, bad luck, spirits, stuff like that. She wore all black for a month when the king passed away, even when they were visiting the US.

But when my mom was visiting Thailand, she told me a story one morning, that thier was a knock on the door and these monks she thinks were Buddhists, (based on their robes)  but they were definitely religious in nature 

But they never said anything and then her step mom saw and got my grandpa

Basically it was either that what ever group these people were apart of these men were either not allowed to talk to woman or they believed woman should only speak with spoken to.

I don’t know the ins and outs but that’s what happened.


My Grandma on my moms sides is Filipino, she grew up Catholic but said she had Buddhists on her island as a kid.

So what I do know/ like about Buddhism is

Your basic world history lesson

Founding in India/Nepal Border

8 fold paths

Fat Buddha is not the same as Siddhartha.

Buddha means The Enlightened One.

Karma

Reincarnation 

quasi mystical figures demons and and folklore (would really appreciate an explanation on this because I know their is no Deity in Buddhism)

Certain Hindus traditions argue that the Buddha is a Avatar of Vishnu, to spread good habits and morals.

Different kinds of Buddhism 

Fat Buddha, or Budai, is based on a somewhat real folklore character in China from like the 10th century and some people believe he was a kinda like that eras version of the Buddha.

Buddha is a title not just a name.


The kinda goal is Enlightenment achieving nirvana. Reduce suffering, being a good person.

Which is something I find cool it seems very Socratic in nature.

The post was a picture of a monk and some text relating what he was saying.

Essentially that the Dharma makes exclusive claims about the nature of reality that cannot be reconciled with belief systems that are outside of the Buddhadharma.

Struggling to make sense of what exactly did I just read.

After reading too many texts that made seem Buddhism like just a series of Sadhanas, and vows and made seem Amithaba like a Jesus-like figure I decided to read this book. Thinking that I would really like it since I read lots of Atheistic and Agnostic literature and liked it.

Before continuing with the review I invite you to read the book and form your opinion. 

First things first, this book helped form my opinions on Buddhism by offering a new perspective. Now that the positives have ended let's start with the review:

The book doesn't know what it wants to be,  it feels like the author was trying to write four different books at the same time. In barely 200 pages he is trying to:

Present the eightfold part without any theistic or metaphysical components.

Write a workbook on living a good and happy life as an agnostic.

Writing a book about mindfulness and meditation

Laying out a plan for a Western Buddhist Community. 

​

While the gnostic workbook is pretty well written, and it demonstrates a considerable amount of research, work and soul searching, the other parts do not. 

​

When trying to explain the eightfold path he shows Gautama Buddha as a figure uncorrupted by the future ""degeneracy"", ""mysticism"" and ""institutionalized and religious Buddhism"" without all those ""religious fantasies"" that cloud the mystery that is life. Failing right into a fallacy by saying that Gautama Buddhism is authentic Buddhism, no religion but a path of practice and those orthodox institutions aren't. 

What is authentic Buddhism? What is the authentic eightfold path? If a school of Buddhism has sadhanas and rituals is it less Buddhism? He doesn't seem to understand emptiness. There is no trascendal idea of Buddhism which you can measure all other Buddhisms.

Even the author contradicts himself some chapters later when is shown that even in the earliest scripture Buddhism always had some metaphysics and a hierarchy. By stripping away those things, would we obtain a Buddhism more Buddhism than Gautama's own?  

 

I refuse to believe a scholar of Buddhism attacked many aspects of a wild array of traditions and schools without making any distinctions, or even saying which traditions he was referring to!

When he is attacking the Guru-Disciple relationship reminiscent of medieval times he is attacking Vajrayana Buddhism. When he is attacking the belief that enlightenment is not for this life, he is attacking Pure Land Buddhism. 

Even then there are differences! Many teachers of Vajrayana take distance from the traditional Guru-Disciple relationship. Many Pure Land practitioners strive their hardest to become as enlightened as possible in this life.

​

Also, did I say that he explained the eightfold path? No, I mean that he started only to switch subjects and go unto mindfulness and Self.

​

The guide to meditation is scattered across the book and is atrocious. I don't know who S is, why he is HIV positive, or what is his relationship with the author, but is annoying. 

The whole thing reads like a flow of consciousness. The whole thing is soporific, there is no flow between one paragraph and the next, hell, there isn't even a proper logical flow to them!

As soon as the author is saying something interesting he is back again rambling about the Self-No Self dichotomy, awareness and a mountain of I and ME which makes him seem like an egocentric more than an adept meditator. If you pick a paragraph from the middle of the book I couldn't tell you which chapter it was, because it keeps hammering the Self-No Self and awareness discussion over and over and over and over and over again, only making it more confusing. I can't imagine anyone taking this book as a guide to mindfulness and not being confused.

​

It is painfully clear that his ideas of what religion is stem from Christianity. He proclaims himself as an agnostic but comes off as an atheist who believes that all metaphysics and mysticism are fantasies. He also doesn't understand mysticism at all. Saying that awakening isn't a mystical experience and once even comparing devoted mystics to addicted artists seeking escape in opium and drinks. What?  

Is also diamond clear, excuse the pun, that he never practised Vajranaya, nor understands how all those rituals and Sadhanas might help unto the path of awakening. Or that, since there are so many persons, of a so varied nature, is better for many traditions and paths to exist.

His idea for a Buddhist Western community seems like a recipe for cultural appropriation and watering down. To create this ""deeply agnostic"" community we should: 

Discard references and talk about ANY and ALL metaphysics as fantasies or the product of their time, including those of Gautama's early discourses.     

Throw away most Sutras, Tantras, Sadhanas and rituals, as religious degeneracy.

Throw away any and all things about deities or Guru relationships as the product of orthodox institutions trying to repress imagination and creativity.

Since we are there, following the author's logic, we should also throw away Satori and all mystical experiences as mere fantasies or products of mad men.

Since we made all those things, we should also go preaching to all other traditions of Buddhism about how their traditions are filled with superstitions and degeneracy. If you think that this point is absurd, it already happened! I tremble in fear thinking that even one person gave this book as a good introduction to Buddhism!

 

All in all the book is soporific and confusing, filled with conclusions about Buddhism by someone who doesn't understand the practice and should be ignored in discussions on how the Western Buddhism community should be built.

Recently the issue of healing trauma has come front and center. This includes physically - I injured myself somewhat badly recently, and I had to gradually heal and then regain flexibility in the injured muscles and nerves etc. But also psychologically, I have had to turn to the issue of trauma out of direct necessity.

I had a traumatic childhood for a couple of reasons. A lot of it centered around my mother who, if you were to be clinical about it, you might say has narcissistic personality disorder and maybe borderline and maybe histrionic… maybe more, who knows. Both of my parents were themselves very traumatised, each for their own reasons.

Going through this kind of experience in childhood can turn life into a living death. I have always felt this living death and I never really understood it. It was difficult to have perspective on it.

For example, even as as child when I saw a train coming I longed to jump in front of it. In high school, I had difficulty sleeping and intense suicidal visions and desire. There was no way to not feel this way. The energy was just in my body. Depression like a black cloud so hopeless like an endless pit was always looming from the corner and there was no escape from it.

The thing about trauma is that it can cause deep physical/emotional/ and existential pain even as circumstances are good. Part of your heart is frozen in time perpetually re-living the moment of your worst nightmare like a Buddhist hell realm.

This morning, for example, I heard my wife (who is an angel and whom I love) open the bathroom door and my heart exploded with anxiety and sickly painful feeling. Even as an old man my heart still feels terror at the sound of a door opening because of all of the things my mother did to me as a child.

In some ways living with trauma is like being a Frankenstein. You are broken and no matter what you do nothing will bring an end to your pain. Even if the conditions of your life are good and you have what you need it won’t be enough. Some part of you is always praying for death, with your eye on the clock of how many years you have to endure this before you can finally let go.

For a long time I struggled with rage, which can simmer off of helplessness and hopelessness. When you’re abused as a kid, you turn bitter towards the whole world because the world let them do it. If you have a parent who is tormenting you or molesting you or whatever, or a family where outwardly things are proper but inwardly abuse is taking place. it can seem as the whole world has taken the side of the abuser and this will make you want to burn down the world.

In some ways I have had a charmed life. I always have lived in safe and functioning communities (outside of family). If I had grown up in a place which has high crime our threat of violence to men on the street or threats of bullying I probably would have developed into a psycho.

This is what happened to Mike Tyson. He was abused in all kinds of ways as a kid but specifically he was raped and people took his violence as a circus act but actually he was a hurt little boy trying and failing to protect himself. Mike showed the world what the rage that grows in the hearts of abused kids looks like. He just had the muscle and temperament to express it in a way everyone can see. Mostly - people just seethe, and if this violence gets expressed, it is against onesself. in 2023, 50,000 Americans killed themselves.

I personally have not felt that oppressed as a male. As an adult and through my life, I have known a lot of women who were supportive and understanding. It is a common trope on reddit that women will judge and betray you if you express any emotion but this was not my experience at all.

But my experience was the exception. Most men with this kind of trauma only know one option -to seethe. The kind of resources that do appeal to angry men are quite mercilessly ridiculed. Many years ago, I used to be on TRP the subreddit. I was an “endorsed contributor.” On another username. There was something going on in the community at that time that seemed valuable to an angry young man. One thing that the men's right's activists, who among popular society are considered essentially as equivalent to nazis, talk about his how unfair the divorce regime in the US is. I'd seen this with my own two eyes as my mother monstrously took everything from my father, and he had to live in a car to survive, compelled by the state to pay her nearly everything. Why is the system set up like this? State-sanctioned spite against fathers doesn't benefit the kids, why do we do it? TRP calls this the ""feminine imperative."" Generally their ideas about it are extreme, but this is an experience shared by legions of men and there has to be place to discuss it just in the way that there has to be a place to discuss women's experiences of abuse. Public antipathy towards men's concerns keeps emotionally vulnerable men in a box and drives them towards seething and brooding, antisocial behaviors, and farther to political extremes. Alienating angry people, men especially, can lead to a ""joker complex."" Usually women lash ""in"" but men lash ""out"" and lurking in the collective psyche, of America in particular, is the fantasy of the hero who goes out guns blazing against all odds. Having grown up in the Columbine era, I've watched this fantasy do what it does in the collective psyche - it simmers.

The taboo against men showing anger is not healthy. One of the issues of trauma is the tendency to repress your natural emotions - especially sadness, pain, loneliness, hopelessness, etc. - in order to maintain the appearance of someone in control. For emotionally broken men the only way they know how to do that is with anger. And it may be that angrily is the only way they know how to relate to emotions.

In the case of my wife, she is not afraid of my anger. If I feel anger, due to a trauma reaction or for whatever reason, she can understand that I’m having the emotion without it being “at her” and this she feels no sense of threat. She is able to give me the patience and presence of mind to sort out what I am experiencing without expecting that I hide some of my emotions. This has been very helpful. Truthfully - if I had to hide some emotions from her because she acted threatened by my authentic feelings, I don't think I could do it. I wouldn't be able to sort out my shit in front of her if she were like that. Its so important for people to allow their partners space to process their emotions authentically if they care about their well being.

In general, healing trauma is so fucking difficult. Talk to anybody who had psycho narcissist parents or who have been molested or raped or seen combat or etc. It rips your psyche in half and it’s almost impossible to fix on one’s own. It requires a lot of support. Almost nobody has that support. If you look out into the world, how easy it is to become traumatised, how many people are carrying this inside them, and living lives of desperate misery.

It is no accident that the US has an addiction problem with opiates. Painkillers. Why would people take painkillers? Because they are in pain.

There is what they sometimes call in psychology a “psychosomatic symptom.” The physical sickness derives from an emotional energy stuck in your body. Recently, I have felt pain or discomfort in my heart as it beat. And as I meditated on this I realised that the pain in my heart was fear, that previously had been repressed deeply enough that I couldn’t perceive it. I think that in some way Buddhist practice is about findind and resolving this energy even at subtle levels.

I have heard a few people talk about “shadow work.” That the “shadow” is the concealed sub-conscious. I think for me, recognising that the discomfort in my heart was a “psychosomatic” expression of fear is sort of an expression of “shadow work.” This kind of vocabulary is maybe sort of magical and shamanic, but I think that this kind of thing can also be understood as psychology.

I am at a point where it is necessary for me to pursue fear - intentionally - in my own mind because I can now see that it is making me sick. As I mentioned about my heart. Or the door opening. I guess that I maybe did not have this perspective about it before.

I recently was walking in the forest at night. I am not afraid of the forest, or of the night, but in dark shadowy places your mind can fill in the blanks with your own latent emotions. I found this really helpful to do. Because I want to see it, I want it to let out. Latent fear is sickening. You don’t want it to stay hidden. You want to recognise it.

I think that other aspects of Buddhist practice maybe set the stage where it was possible to realise some of these things. When we try to tangle with our own minds we are constrained by karma. If we are in bondage to some karmic patterns, even if we wish to heal then it may be impossible. It’s only ever possible to find an improvement in our conditions if the karmic conditions allow it.

I think that proper Buddhist practice will, if we can’t heal right away, set the stage karmically that healing is eventually possible. In my own case, I think that my karmic tendencies were quite severe and it took quite a few years of Buddhist practice before my merit was sorted out enough that I could even see clearly what had happened to me. But if you are in that circumstance - if you are suffering and nothing seems to help… you essentially have no choice but to engage in practices to rectify your karmic conditions until help becomes available. There is no other way. The only question is how bad is the suffering. If it’s not so bad, you might put it off. But if life is really fucking you in the \*\*\* right now, then you’re going to be highly motivated to really figure out how to get relief from suffering. It will burn too much not to.

Teal Swan has some interesting materials. Gabor Mate is good. Peter Levine is good.

What I mean here is that there is a form of the practice, with particular instructions, which relates to the exoteric aspect, and then there is an essential understanding of the meaning and purpose of the practice, which relates to the esoteric aspect.

For example with metta or brahmavihara meditation, we may engage with a particular formula where we go through various words and specifically mentally imagine or visualize certain steps. This would be the exoteric structure of the practice. However, with enough practice, we may more and more realize the fullness of the meaning and purpose of the practice, and then we may find that we don’t need to always follow the exact structure of a formal practice but we may engage with it contextually as fits in our day to day life.

In Dzogchen, for instance, there may be teachings on trekcho that relate to certain postures of the body, mouth, eyes, etc, and other instructions on how to formally engage with trekcho ‘practice’. This would be the exoteric side. But with sufficient experience, we may realize that the essential meaning of trekcho may be applied at all times and places, regardless of our position of our body, regardless of what is going on with body, speech, or mind. This would be the esoteric aspect. 

If you are building a tower, initially you might build a scaffolding. Once the scaffolding is up, then you start to build the tower.

Initially the tower is not fully complete, and so the scaffolding stays up for a while. But once the tower is fully built and strong, then the scaffolding is taken down. 

We might also consider this in relation to precepts, or Vinaya. Initially we may need prescriptions related to our body and speech, as we may be habitually engaged in many behaviors which are troublesome to us and/or others. With time, we may come to focus more on the mind, and we may come to realize that if the mind is chock full of afflictions, then body and speech are very hard to bring into line, whereas if our mind is full of virtue aligned with the path, then body and speech naturally come in line.

At a point, we may find that all we need is a singular focus, and underneath that singular focus all good gathers. Perhaps, maybe, as Ajahn Mun said that he only follows one singular precept. 

Anyway, came to mind.

One other consideration is that it may, possibly, be that sometimes we only look at the exoteric side and neglect to see the esoteric side.

For example, we might have a habit of thinking that a realized being has to manifest in a particular form, showing particular manifestations of body or speech. But we may miss that there may be realized beings who manifest many modes of body and speech contextually in line with the essence of dharma and Vinaya, without this necessarily being ‘exoterically’ Buddhist.

We enjoy creating the obstacles of three poisons, refusing to take the three refuges. We enjoy creating the obstacles of five rebellious act, refusing to abide by the five precepts.

We enjoy the evil ghost karmic hindrances of slandering the Triple Gem, destroying the good deeds of good people, refuse to protect and treasure the Triple Gem, to support and rejoice in the full merits and virtues of others. We prefer to undergo the karmic hindrances in the triple realm, to be bind up as man or devas for a long time and refuse to seek the liberation of No-birth in the Pure Land.

Karmic hindrances and sins such like these are committed by oneself, by teaching others, by rejoicing in others’ acts. They are done purposely, by mistake, playfully, angrily with blames, in accordance or with discordance in love and hatred, immeasurably, limitlessly, with inexhaustible thoughts, inexhaustible words. This is the way sins are committed by us, by all living beings which resemble the innumerable fine dust on the great earth, the limitless empty space, the limitless dharma realm, the limitless Dharma Nature, the limitless expedients. Sinful offences such like these are unknown by all the Bodhisattvas, all the Sravakas, the Pratyeka the conditioned enlightened ones. Only all the Buddhas are able to know the exact amount of our sins and offences.

如是障罪，自作、教他、見作隨喜。若故作、誤作、戲笑作、瞋嫌作、違順愛憎作，無量無邊。思量不可盡，說不可盡。亦如大地微塵無數、虛空無邊、法界無邊、法性無邊、方便無邊，我及眾生造罪亦復如是。如是等罪，上至諸菩薩，下至聲聞、緣覺，所不能知；唯佛與佛，乃能知我罪之多少。

In the Sutra of the Hell, the 5th Roll of the Sutra on the Buddha Contemplation Samadhi, it is thus said, ‘Living beings who have committed these sins are cut down by the knives of wind before they pass away. They cannot lie down to sleep just as though they are being beaten up. Their mind without the Dharma practice is crazy, confused and deluded. They can see that their room and house are full of men and women, old and young and all kinds of impurities. The whole house is stink with

faeces, urine that overflow all over the place until outside. At that time the offender would say, ‘Why aren’t there any good cities, mountains or forests for me to play around? Why is this place so dirty, with so many unclean things?’

《地獄經》(《觀佛三昧經》卷五意)云：「若有眾生作是罪者，臨命終時，風刀解身。偃臥不定，如被楚撻。其心荒越，發狂癡想。見己室宅，男女大小，一切皆是不淨之物。屎尿臭處，盈流於外。爾時罪人即作是語：『云何此處無好城郭及好山林，使吾遊戲，乃處如此不淨物間？』

After saying this, the jailers, the rakshasas use their big iron fork to carry and transform the Avici hell and the forests of knives into the jewel forests, the cooling ponds. The flames are transformed into lotuses with golden sepals. The iron mouth worms are transformed into wild ducks and wild geese. The cries and screams in the hell are transformed into songs of praise. On hearing this, the offenders say, ‘It is such a good place. I will visit it.’ After thinking thus, he is sitting on the flaming lotuses with all the iron mouth worms enter his body from the hair pore, biting at his body. Hundreds of thousands iron wheels enter him from the top of his head. His eyes are poked out with iron forks equivalent to Ganges sands. The copper dogs of the hell are transformed into ten thousand million iron dogs fighting and dividing his body so as to devour his heart.

作是語已，獄卒羅剎以大鐵叉擎阿鼻獄。及諸刀林，化作寶樹及清涼池。火炎化作金葉蓮華，諸鐵嘴蟲化為鳧雁，地獄痛聲如歌詠音。罪人聞已：『如此好處，吾當遊中。』念已尋時坐火蓮華。諸鐵嘴蟲，從身毛孔唼食其軀。百千鐵輪，從頂上入。恆沙鐵叉，挑其眼睛。地獄銅狗，化作百億鐵狗，競分其身，取心而食。

At that moment, the body looks like an iron lotus which fills up the eighteen sections fully. Every lotus is with 84 thousand sepals. Every sepal is the head, the hands and different parts of the body, filling up the space of one section. The hell is not big, the body is not small. They fully fill up everywhere in the great hell. These offenders who fall into the hell will live for 84 thousand great Kalpas. When this hell becomes extinct, they will be transferred to the 18 sections in the eastern direction and undergo sufferings as before. This Avici hell consists of 18 sections in the south, 18 sections in the west and also 18 sections in the north.

俄爾之間，身如鐵華，滿十八隔中。一一華葉，八萬四千；一一葉頭，身手支節，在一隔間。地獄不大，此身不小，遍滿如此，大地獄中。此等罪人，墮此地獄，經歷八萬四千大劫。此泥犁滅，復入東方十八隔中，如前受苦。此阿鼻地獄，南亦十八隔，西亦十八隔，北亦十八隔。

Those who slander the Vaipulya, who have committed the five rebellious sins, who destroy the Sangha, who defile the Bhikshuni, who have severed the wholesome roots. These sinful people with all kinds of offences will have their body filling up the Avici hell fully. Their four limbs will again appear to fill up the 18 sections fully. This Avici hell will burn up all these hellish living beings. When the Kalpas is coming to an end, the eastern gate will open up and they can see the clear spring water, the rivers, flowers, fruits and forests and such appearances outside the eastern gate. These offenders will see these appearances from the lower section. The fire from their eyes become extinct temporarily.

謗方等經，具五逆罪，破壞僧祇，污比丘尼，斷諸善根，如此罪人，具眾罪者，身滿阿鼻獄，四肢復滿十八隔中。此阿鼻獄，但燒如此獄種眾生。劫欲盡時，東門即開。見東門外，清泉流水，華果林樹，一切俱現。是諸罪人，從下隔見，眼火暫歇。

From the bottom section, they climb on their stomach, trying hard to climb up to the top section, with their hands clutching at the wheel of knives. At that time heated iron pellets are rained down from the empty space. They walk towards the eastern gate. On their arrival at the threshold the rakshasa jailers hold on to the iron forks will poke at their eyes. The iron dogs devour their hearts. They faint and die. After passing away, they are born instantly. They could see the southern gate is open. In this way, the process is repeated. This happening is repeated at the western gate and the northern gate also. In this way, half a Kalpa has already passed by.

從下隔起，婉轉腹行，揵身上走，到上隔中，手攀刀輪。時虛空中，雨熱鐵丸。走趣東門。既至門閫，獄卒羅剎，手捉鐵叉，逆刺其眼。鐵狗齧心，悶絕而死，死已復生。見南門開，如前不異。如是西門、北門亦皆如此。如此時間，經歷半劫。

After they have passed away from the Avici hell they are born in the icy cold hell. After passing away from the icy cold hell, they are born in darkness. Throughout eighty thousand years they dwell in darkness, not seeing anything. They are born as gigantic snakes, crawling on the stomach. Their consciousness dwell in darkness as they cannot understand anything. They are controlled by hundreds of thousand foxes and wolves which pull at them, eating them up. After passing away, they are born as animals. For fifty thousand times they are born in the form of birds and animals. After that they are born into the human realm, suffering deaf, blindness and mute. They are born with a body covered with scabies, carbuncle or ulcer. They are born into poverty and inferiority. They decorate themselves with all the unfortunate circumstances. They receive this inferior form for five hundred times. Later, they will again be born into the realm of hungry ghosts. In this way, they transmigrate non-stop in the immeasurable, limitless three evil paths.’

阿鼻獄死，生寒冰中。寒冰獄死，生黑闇處，八千萬歲，目無所見，受大蛇身，婉轉腹行，諸情闇塞，無所解知，百千狐狼，牽掣食之。命終之後，生畜生中，五千萬身，受鳥獸形。還生人中，聾盲喑啞，疥癩癰疽，貧窮下賤，一切諸衰以為嚴飾。受此賤身，經五百身，後還得生餓鬼之中。如是等輪迴三惡，無量無邊。」

On hearing the sufferings in the hell, we, the disciples are most terrified, with our hairs standing on ends. We are enveloped in immeasurable frights. After undergoing such unending terrors, frights and deformities, we still have to wander in sufferings. From this life itself, we have committed all kinds of offences heedlessly with the three karmas, creating heavy sins. If we do not seek repentance, we will surely undergo such sufferings without respite, without a date of release.

Now, before the Triple Gem, before the multitudes in the Way place, we proclaim our sins to seek repentance. Seeking repentance is indeed the serenity bliss. We know our faults and we dare not cover them up.

May the Triple Gem in the ten directions, the living beings of the Dharma realm bring forth Great Kindness and Great Compassion. With their Great Kindness and Compassion, they forgive my evils. In the way as the grass that covers up the great earth, please bestow upon me the happiness. Please accept my repentance and I will be pure again. May the Triple Gem embrace us with kindness and compassion, gather us in and protect us. The offences which we have committed, may they be put into extinction. Offences which have not arisen, may they not come forth. Whatever good deed which we have done may they grow and flourish. Whatever good deeds which have not been cultivated, may they grow with expedients.

弟子眾等，今聞地獄，心驚毛豎，怖懼無量；恐畏殘殃不盡，復還流浪。今生以來，縱暴三業，造眾重罪，若不懺悔，定招此苦，無有出期。

今對三寶、道場大眾前，發露懺悔即安樂，知而不敢覆藏。

唯願十方三寶、法界眾生發大慈悲。廣大慈悲，不計我惡；如草覆地，布施歡喜；受我懺悔，憶我清淨。唯願不捨慈悲，攝護我等。已作之罪願除滅，未起之罪願不生；已作之善願增長，未作之善方便令生。

From today onwards, until before our attainment of patience, we vow to share with all living beings to leave evils and to return to Proper.  We will bring forth the Bodhi Mind, treating each other with a kind heart, looking at each other with the eyes of the Buddha. We will become the Bodhi retinue, the genuine Good Knowing Advisers. We will be born into the Pure Land together until our arrival at Buddhahood. All the offences which we have mentioned will forever be severed, discontinued and no longer in existence. We do not dare to cover them up.

願從今日，乃至不起忍以來，誓共眾生，捨邪歸正，發菩提心，慈心相向，佛眼相看。菩提眷屬，真善知識，同生淨土，乃至成佛。如是等罪，永斷相續，更不敢覆藏。

After bringing forth the vows, we take refuge in Amitabha Buddha sincerely.

This is followed by verses of praise: We seek to attain a rebirth. We seek to attain a rebirth. May we be born standing before Amitabha Buddha with our hands holding the fragrant flowers as offerings always.

After these verses are sung, we thus praise: We seek to attain a rebirth. We seek to attain a rebirth. May we be born sitting in the Assemblies of Amitabha Buddha, with our hands holding the fragrant flowers always as offerings to the Buddha.

He raised me like he was my father, and I miss him every single day.

Last night, my mother (my grandfather's ex-daughter-in-law) dreamed about him. In the dream, he was in a crowd of people, as if it was some kind of ""excursion"". He approached my mother. She said that he looked healthy and well (unlike when he passed away from cancer. He was very physically weakened then). He then told my mother that he had undergone a long treatment for cancer, but that he was now completely cured. Finally, he asked her to tell me that he missed me very much. He got on a bus and left, along with that crowd of people.

It turns out that my aunt (my grandfather's daughter) also had a dream about him that same night. She didn't give many details, but explained that he appeared to be healthy and well (which was unusual, as he always appeared sick and weak in her dreams).

I feel very emotional about this situation, and I think it's too much of a coincidence to be just a coincidence.

It's also important to say that my mother has prophetic dreams. Like, a lot. I'm not lying. She sometimes know things that don't happened yet, or learn things in her dreams that she wouldn't know by normal means.

I wanted to know the Buddhist perspective on this event. In my opinion, my grandfather, who died addicted to cigarettes, was reincarnated as a hungry ghost. This would explain his sick looks in my aunt's dreams about him. Now, I think he came to tell us that he was ready to reincarnate again in a higher realm.

Do hungry ghosts remember their former lives as humans? How long do they live?

Sorry for the bad english. It's not my native language.

EDIT: as for the ones who answered that this is just a manifestation of grief, I understand that. But I forgot to say that my mother had no communication or strong feelings for my grandfather.

I do not call myself a Buddhist since there is no subject that can be something stable and always the same, nor do I believe in rebirth since I do not believe in supernatural phenomenology, nor in karma as a metaphysical entity.
I see rebirth as constant becoming, becoming which also manifests itself after the irreversible cessation of consciousness and its psychological shackles, the annihilation of consciousness, in various forms and manifestations which are suffering, and I see karma as the fifth remembrance: 'my actions are my only true property, there is no escaping the consequences of my actions, my actions are the foundation on which I stand', there is no action in this universe which is not the cause of a related consequence, and so on.
I honour the Buddha for employing his existence in the search for salvation from the main problem of the difficult human condition: suffering, providing us with precise guidelines and a form of gnosis suitable for dispelling the ignorance of conventional language, unveiling the profound insubstantiality of all conditioned phenomena, and the vanity of emotional attachment to them, the vanity of desiring and craving them.",False,Home altar,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1c0e5a4

How does Buddhism and its dhamma would respond to it?

Most of moral instances and morality discussion seems to have assumption of civilized society in the background. 
But to what extent these values and virtues hold in the difficult times such as conflict between oppressors and oppressed. And what new moral standard becomes reality. 

Let's there is society where a specific community has withhold enomorous power over Institutions, politics and narratives.  
This community has also support of some another community, together with they aspir to keep masses under control and weak by limiting their access to knowledge and work. They even imposed inhuman conditions and financial burdens such taxes on them. Basically they do everything to let those oppressed live and work for them. 

Here is an interesting thing, the oppressed here are somehow being convinced that why their oppression is justified (maybe based on religious values, historical values etc). The narratives and Institutional control helps in this regard. The oppressors are also clever, Since they have control/limitations over knowledge and works of oppressed along with Institutional powers. They have mastered the art of generational memory loss and how to do it on the oppressed community. Now there has been some protests from the oppressed against the oppressors but they lost and those events got converted into mythological stories somehow asserting the superiority of oppressors. The narrative control and limitations to knowledge and work helped the oppressors to manipulate masses to forget and believe something else.



Now let's fast forward they are in modern world. 
And the form of oppression has changed, it's not directly as inhuman as it used to be. But there are still dominance of those oppressors in Institutions, politics, narratives. This dominance still results in inhuman conditions of oppressed because of capitalist nature of their modern society (basically lack of resources and education etc for the oppressed).

Now the new generations of oppressed, they slowly starts to uncover the tits and bits of their history and realise the invisible hands throughout history which always hold them back. Naturally many of them grew hatred for the oppressors. 
Now they have to fight back.

1. Will the oppressed here be justified in being completely inhuman if needed to overthrow oppressors and punish them? 

2. Will punishment and revenge be justified in this scenario? As the oppressors have time and time again proved, how they will try to change narratives and history to impose their power over oppressed. Can the oppressed be allowed to do cleansing of the oppressors from moral point of view. 

3. Being ethical and moral has never been trait of the oppressors, they used any means to impose their narratives and dominance.  Whereas weak oppressed have tried to develope utilitarian philosophy to morally convince everyone in long term and fighting in civilized way to come of oppression. Alas the present oppressed don't know their ancestors tried similar method in the past, but slowly oppressors again highjacked the utilitarian philosophy and slowly again revert to oppression using narratives control and making generational memory loss of oppressed. 

Should the oppressed here go for inhuman philosophy, about those oppressors community doesn't deserve the equality in any sense but punishment and revenge?

I also posted in r/PureLand but haven't received much help in the way of answers yet and I figured here would get more viewpoints on things. 

For context I'm a guy from the Southeastern part of the U.S. I have no Buddhist temples close to me, nor do I have any Buddhist friends. I started my journey going from Agnostic to looking into and learning from Christianity, Islam, Paganism, Hinduism, and now Buddhism. Of these Hinduism and Buddhism strike me the most but I've struggled to determine to which I belong.  I've been learning more about Buddhism as I like a lot of what I've read about the Pure Land, Amitabha Buddha, bodhisattvas such as Kannon, Jizo, Daiseishi, and the ethics of Buddhism.

My questions aren't meant to be disrespectful and if they comes off as foolish or stupid, well that's how I feel when I think of them so it fits.

- If enlightenment includes the ending of the 5 aggregates, which include perception, mind, and consciousness, then what exactly is left to experience the ""Bliss"" of nirvana/afterlife after dying since there'd be no feeling, thinking, perceiving, memories, or awareness of any type?

- Are Buddhas eternal, individual, aware, experiencing, thinking beings? I've read that Buddhas are eternal in a way and that it's to do with the Trikaya or Dharma Body, Reward Body, and Emanation Body, but I don't quite understand this. If they were aware and thinking and experiencing doesn't that mean that the skandhas/aggregates continue on since they are needed in order to perceive, think, and be aware?

- If a Buddha does somehow exist without the aggregates then what causes them to end and enter Parinirvana?

- I know Buddhism doesn't believe in a non-changing, permanent soul, but what about a ""soul"" (for lack of a better word) that does change from life to life, but acts as a storage house or container for all the memories or experiences that occur throughout all of those lifetimes? And then once achieving Enlightenment or Buddhahood you then gain access to those memories and experiences again in full? So it changes and isn't ""permanent"" but more a collection that you then regain access to after a time?



Like I said I'm sure these questions seems foolish or misguided, and they are formed from my reading a bunch of different books, blogs, posts, and videos, but they are what my mind gets hung up on. And any answers I've tried to find are given either in riddles, vague metaphors that I don't understand, or dismissed. *Is there any resource I can turn to help figure this stuff out?*

With Hinduism I felt like I understood the majority of what I needed in terms of theology and philosophy to make sense of things. The only thing was that there were cultural aspects I disagree on, such as mandatory vegetarianism, and I'm not 100% sure if I believe in a Omnipotent God. While I really feel drawn to many aspects of Buddhism like I mentioned above, the philosophy isn't as easy to grasp as Vishishtadvaita was since everything is answered in riddles and left vague rather than explained like in the Gita or Ramanuja's Sri Bhashya.",False,General beginner questions that I can't shake from my mind.,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/1c0qvjw/general_beginner_questions_that_i_cant_shake_from/

I (44) was never religious, which was mainly because I couldn‘t find any deeper access to Christianity. I was more open to spirituality, but also had no practice.

Two years ago, I decided to learn meditation and practice it regularly. Because of meditation, I came across Youtube videos of Ajahn Sona a year ago and was amazed at how practical his advice is and that Buddhism or religion can actually have answers and advice to the various adversities of life.

From then on, I began to spend several hours a week studying Buddhism and because I was impressed by Ajahn Sona's way of thinking and could follow his arguments, I made up my mind to devote myself to Theravada Buddhism.

Recently, because I was interested in the subject, I read the book ""The True Source of Healing: How the Ancient Tibetan Practice of Soul Retrieval Can Transform and Enrich Your Life"" by Tenzin Wangyal Wangyal Rinpoche, which obviously is not based on Theravada tradition.

It describes techniques for connecting with the five elements. Now I have mainly practiced this informally when I am out in nature, that I encounter the five elements with Open Awareness. I have had more success with this in a short space of time than with my previous meditation practice. It has a clear calming and grounding effect on me.

Now I'm wondering what that means. Should I look more into Open Awareness Meditation (Dzogchen?)? Can this be combined with Theravada? I'd hate to give up the teachings of Ajahn Sona, and I've only just got through a fraction of it.

TLDR: Started to learn about Theravada Buddism a year ago because I found a teacher that inspired me. Recently I found an meditation technique from the Tibetian Bön tradition that has a profound grounding and calming effect on me, more than what I learned so far in Theravada. Does this mean, I should switch from Theravada to Bön. Or can I dedicate myself to both? Because in terms of daily practise I only can do the one or the other.

To identify the self and the mind’s clinging to it, it is said that although duality is devoid of essence, it is misconceived as possessing substantiality, due to inbred delusion. The mind develops attachments and clings to the two self-entities of subject and object. Conversely, the nonexistence of the two innate selves is nonduality.  

Candrakīrti in his commentary to the *Catuḥśataka* says:  

>*What is described as the self (ātman) is the essence or the inborn entity, the existence of which does not depend on external conditions. Selflessness (anātman) is without such a self. Selflessness of material and mental phenomena are so designated because the two distinctions are made in the form of material elements and personality (dharma and pudgala).*  

Dharmakīrti says:  

>*The dual realities categorized according to their inherent characteristics are designated as “dharmas” (the elements of material phenomena) while personality is stated to consist of man’s stream-consciousness (mindstream) that coalesces with the physical constituents.*  

The *Dho Silbu* summarizes:  

>*All [the realities of] the elements bearing inherent characteristics are designated as “dharmas.” The stream-consciousness is designated as personality (pudgala).*  

The self of personality (pudgala-ātman) consists of the innate consciousness that assigns to itself, as its own nature, an eternal, independent entity and thereby clings to the notion of “I” or “self.” The self of material elements (dharma-ātman) is the product of the mind grasping at realities, such as the physical constituents of life, as being objective realities composed of innate substance and clinging to them as such. These two “selves” engender karma, defilement, affliction and harm.  

Śrī Dharmakīrti comments:  

>*By conceiving of the self, one perceives the existence of others. Differentiating between self and others causes attachment and hatred. Entanglement with these causes afflictions.*  

The *Ratnāvalī* elucidates:  

>*As long as clinging to the aggregates [of life] exists, so long does clinging to the self persist. Where there is clinging to the self, there is karma. Karma causes rebirth.*   

In order to eliminate the stream of existence caused by clinging to the self, it is essential to meditate upon the meaning of selflessness.  

Dharmakīrti states:  

>*Without subduing the subjective base of this [self], one cannot eliminate it.*  

The *Catuḥśataka* comments:  

>*When one perceives nonselfhood in the perceptive base, the seed of cyclic existence will cease to exist.*  

The *Madhyamakāvatāra* says:  

>*All defilements and afflictions originate from conceiving as real the transient aggregates of being. Only by perceiving this and investigating the realms of this self, can a yogin eliminate it [the self].*  

Only by meditating upon the truth of nonselfhood can one eliminate the deluded view and the clinging to the “I” and “mine.” Such an elimination terminates rebirth caused by clinging, sensuality, and the rest. In this way liberation is fully achieved.  

The *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* says:  

>*Upon the elimination of “I’ and “mine,” internal and external realities, the psychophysical aggregates will cease. With this, rebirth, karma and defilements will cease, and thus liberation will be achieved.*  

The *Ratnāvalī* states:  

>*Assertion of the reality of “I” and “mine” is a distortion of the dharma.*    

The self of the personality is thus stated to be nonexistent. The logic concerning the nonexistent self states that, if it exists, it must emerge either in oneself, in others, in both or in the three periods of time. Since this self has not emerged in these, it is nonexistent. The same text states:  

>*Since the self has not emerged out of oneself, others, or both, nor been born in the three periods of time, clinging to the self can therefore be eliminated.*    

Furthermore, if the self of personality exists, it must necessarily be either identical to the psychophysical aggregates or distinct from them. Both of these hypotheses are untenable.  

The *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* comments:  

>*When one says that no self exists except for the rebirth-seeking aggregates, it means that these aggregates are identical with the self. Then the self is indeed nonexistent.*  

The same text states:  

>*If the aggregates are the self, then it too will be subject to birth and death.*   

Thus the contention that the self is identical with the psychophysical aggregates has been refuted. If one assumes that the [independent] self is subject to the cycle of birth and death, this [self-contradiction] will be refuted through the following inferences. [The self that lost its enduring nature would make the possibility of] recollecting untenable. Memory of a past life would not be possible, committed karma would not product results, and one would experience effects without karmic causes.  

The separate realities of the self and the aggregates are also refuted in the same text:  

>*If the self is a separate entity from the psychophysical aggregates, the characteristics of these aggregates become invalid.*  

The same text continues:  

>*The self is an entity separate from the rebirth-seeking aggregates - this is untenable. For if objective reality without the aggregates were possible, then cognition would not be possible.*  

In the *Madhyamakāvatāra,* it is said:  

>*For all these reasons the self does not exist apart from the aggregates; except for the aggregates, no perceiver exists.*  

Eliminating the self of personality by implication negates the existence [of the substantive nature] of its parts such as the eyes, nose and the rest. 

The *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* states:  

>*If the “I” does not exist, how can there be the “mine?”*  

The *Madhyamakāvatāra* states:  

>*Because there is no actor, there is no action, for there can be no self of a person who is nonexistent. Therefore, the seeker of truth who conceives the emptiness of “I” and “mine” will achieve perfect liberation.*  

The following is a summary of the meditation upon nonselfhood of personality, as stated in the first *Bhāvanākrama:*  

>*There is no personality to be perceived apart from the aggregates, elements and sense faculties. The self is not the essence of the aggregates, etc., because they are essentially transient and composite, whereas personality has been defined by others [such as those of the Brahmanic tradition] as an eternal and independent essence. This self or another undefinable self cannot possibly exist as substantial entities, since there is no reality of substance.

I have been starting to incorporate periods of metta cultivation into my meditation practice, whereby I focus on loving kindness towards:
- oneself
- a loved one or close friend
- a neutral acquaintance
- someone with whom I have difficulty with
…in that order.

In particular, I struggle with cultivating metta towards myself. A strategy I use for others is to take a moment to consider the whole of their lives and its preciousness by picturing their birth, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, whereby I can appreciate them in all of their humanity. However, this strategy doesn’t work for me when I direct it towards myself. 

I seem to get caught up in my ego: when I see the whole of my life, I have a hard time moving pasts the times where I have let others (or myself) down, falling short of expectations, harming others, etc.

Would you have any suggestions or recommendations (your experiences, scripture, or otherwise) to help overcome difficulty in cultivating metta towards oneself?

As such, these deluded men will fall into the evil paths for many kalpas to undergo unending sufferings. But at his death bed, such a deluded man encounters a good knowing adviser who comforts him with all means, who speaks the wonderful dharma for him, who teaches him to recite the Buddha’s Name. The man is overcome by great afflictions and he is unable to have mindfulness of the Buddha. The good friend tells him, “If you are unable to be mindful of the Buddha, you should just recite Immeasurable Lifespan Buddha. By reciting sincerely, in a continual manner. You should call on to Namo Amitabha Buddha for ten times.” As he calls on the Buddha’s Name, in every recitation, 80 billion kalpas of sinful birth and death are eradicated. At the instant of passing away he sees a golden lotus that resembles the sun wheel appears before him. In the arising of one thought he attains a rebirth in the World of Ultimate Bliss. He dwells 12 full Great Kalpas in the lotus before it blooms. Avalokisteshvara, Mahasthamaprapta with their great Brahman Sounds will speak for him expansively on the Genuine mark of all dharma to eradicate the sinful dharma. After listening to the teaching, he rejoices and instantly he brings forth the Bodhi Mind. This is known as the rebirth at the lowest position in the Inferior Grade Lotus. This is the visualization of the rebirth of the Inferior Grade and it is known as the 16th Contemplation. ‘**

Question: In the 48 Vows, it is stated that people who have committed the five rebellious acts, who slander the Proper Dharma cannot attain a rebirth. Now in the Contemplation Sutra, the lowest position of the Inferior Grade gathers in those who have slandered the Dharma, who have committed the five rebellious acts, may I know what is meant by this?

Answer: This is explained based on the Door of restraint. For example, in the 48 Vows, those who have slandered the Dharma, who have committed the five rebellious acts cannot attain a rebirth. This is because these two karmas incur heavy hindrances. Living beings who commit these karmas will go straight to the Avici Hell for many kalpas without a chance to be released. As the Thus Come One is afraid that we will commit these two evils, he speaks expediently that we cannot attain a rebirth. But in actuality, it does not mean the Buddha will leave him out. Moreover, in the lowest position of the Inferior Grade, those who have committed the five rebellious acts are gathered in, except those who have slandered the Dharma. If he has committed the five rebellious acts, the Buddha does not leave him behind, letting him to go into transmigration. Still, he brings forth the compassionate mind to gather him in. This is because he has not slandered the Dharma. Besides, it is said those who have slandered the Dharma cannot attain a rebirth. Talking like this is based on the criteria that they have not created the karma yet. We should thus understand. But if he still creates this bad karma, the Buddha will still gather him in. Even though he is born there, his flower will not open after many kalpas. He faces three obstacles while dwelling in the flower.

a. He does not have a chance to see the Buddha and the Sagely assemblies.

b. He does not have a chance to listen to the Proper Dharma.

c. He does not have a chance to wait upon and attend to all the Buddha, to make offerings to them.

Other than these three there is no other suffering. In the Sutra it is stated that they dwell in the bliss like a bhikshu who has entered the third dhyana. We should thus know. Even though they dwell in the flower for many kalpas the flower is still not blooming. It is still better than falling into the Avici Hell for many long kalpas to suffer the acute pain and tortures. This is the end of the explanation in accord with the Door of restraint.

四從如此愚人下至生死之罪已來。正明聞法念佛得蒙現益。即有其十。一明重牒造 惡之人。二明命延不久。三明臨終遇善知識。四明善人安慰教令念佛。五明罪人死苦來逼。無由得念佛名。六明善友知苦失念。轉教口稱彌陀名號。七明念數多少聲聲無間。八明除罪多劫。九明臨終正念即有金華來應。十明去時遲疾直到所歸之國。

D. From such a deluded man until the sinful birth and death shows the present benefits thus obtained by listening to the Dharma and reciting the Buddha’s Name. There are ten points. a. A man who commits evil persistently. b. He will not be living long. c. He encounters a good knowing adviser at his death bed. d. The good man consoles him and teaches him to be mindful of Amitabha Buddha. e. The offender is oppressed by the sufferings of death. He is unable to be mindful of Amitabha Buddha. f. The Good friends understands that he is in suffering and he has lost his mindfulness. So, instead, he asks him to call out to Amitabha Buddha with his mouth. g. It shows the number of recitations which are uninterrupted. h. Many kalpas of sins are eradicated. i. As he dwells in right mindfulness there is a respond with the coming of a golden lotus. j. It shows the swiftness in attaining a rebirth in that Land.

五從於蓮華中滿十二劫已下。正明第十門中到彼華開遲疾不同。六從觀音大勢下至發菩提心已來。正明第十一門中華開已後得益有異。即有其三。一明二聖為宣甚深妙法。二明除罪歡喜。三明後發勝心。七從是名已下總結。上來雖有七句不同。廣解下品下生竟。

E. From twelve full great Kalpas in the lotus onwards show the 10th Door, the different in time for the flowers to bloom. From Avalokiteshvara , Mahasthamaprapta until brings forth the Bodhi Mind shows the 11th Door, the blooming of the lotus and the difference in obtaining the benefits. There are three points. a. The two Sages teach him the profoundly wonderful Dharma. b. As the sins is eradicated, he is most glad. c. Later he brings forth the supreme mind. G. From is known as onwards is the conclusion. Even though there are the seven different situations, this is the end of the expansive teaching on the lowest position of the Inferior Grade.

讚云。下輩下行下根人 十惡五逆等貪瞋 ,四重偷僧謗正法。未曾慚愧悔前愆。終時苦相如雲集。地獄猛火罪人前。忽遇往生善知識  急勸專稱彼佛名。化佛菩薩尋聲到。一念傾心入寶蓮。三華障重開多劫。於時始發菩提因。

Verses of Praise: The lowest practice of the Inferior Grade are people of inferior roots. They have committed the ten evils, the five rebellious acts and other offences with greed and anger. They have committed the four heavy offences, stolen from the Sangha and slandered the Proper Dharma. Yet they are not remorseful and have no regrets for their sins. At the death bed all the sufferings appear that resemble the gathering of clouds. The fire from the Hell is burning before him. Suddenly he encounters a Good Knowing adviser who teaches him to attain a rebirth. He quickly exhorts him to call out the Name of the Buddha. Instantly the Transformation Buddha and Buddha come when they hear his calls. In the time of the arising of a thought he enters the Jewel Lotus.  The three types of lotuses are heavy in hindrances and it takes them many kalpas to bloom. Only at that time they will bring forth the cause of Bodhi.

Basically, Last night, I had a dream about an eclipse. Which is strange because this happenned very close or as an eclipse was actually happening. But in the dream I witnessed two eclipses and they were lunar eclipses. And strangely enough, the most recent eclipse is not visible from the country I'm from (singapore).

At the same time, in my dream, I had thought of doing buddhist practice whilst the eclipse was taking place. I might've chanted ""om mani padme hum"" or some other mantra. And I remember passing this tibetan buddhist temple called ""Thekchen Choling"", which is a tibetan buddhist temple in Singapore of the gelug tradition; it is the main seat of a lama called Singha Rinpoche. and inside they were doing some things as the eclipse was going on; there might've been ritual sounds or whatnot. Strange, because whilst i've interacted with the temple's content online, i've never actually visited them.

I'm aware that there have been advice to practice during the retreat given by FPMT or lama zopa rinpoche or whatnot, which is what might've influenced me to think of practicing and to chant/recite as the eclipse was going on in my dream.

It's a puzzling dream, i suppose. Would anyone care to tell me what this dream might mean?

If we seek liberation from the travails of this world, we must have a firm faith in the Buddha's assurance that each living being on earth possesses Tathagata wisdom and, therefore, has the potential of attaining Buddhahood. What prevents us from realizing this wisdom and attaining this Buddhahood? The answer is that we simply do not have faith in his assurances. We prefer to remain in ignorance of this truth, to accept the false as genuine, and to dedicate  our lives to satisfying all our foolish cravings. Ignorance of the truth is a disease. Now, as the Buddha taught, the Dharma is like a hospital that has many doors. We can open any one of them and enter into a place of cure. But we must have faith in our physicians and in the efficacy of the treatment.

Dear friends, when you find yourself suffering from the ills of the world, trust in The Great Physician. He has cured millions of others. Which believer has ever perished in his care? Which believer has failed to be restored to eternal life and happiness by following his regimen? None. All have benefited. And so will you if you have faith in his methods.     

Faith is a kind of skill that you can develop. If, for example, you wish to make bean curd, you begin by boiling and grinding the soybeans and then you add a solution of gypsum powder or lemon juice to the boiled beans. You know that you can stand there, if you wish, and watch the curds form. You have faith in your method because it always works. Thus you gain the feeling of certainty. Of course, the first time that you made bean curd, assuming that you were completely unfamiliar with its production, you may have lacked faith in the method. You might have been filled with doubt that gypsum or lemon water would cause the boiled beans to form curds. But once you succeeded and saw with your own eyes that the recipe was correct and that the procedure worked, you accepted without reservation the prescribed method. Your faith in the method was established. Therefore, we must all have faith that we each have a Buddha Nature and that we can encounter this Buddha Nature if we diligently follow a proper Dharma path.

Being resolute in our determination to succeed in whichever method we have chosen, please let me warn you about the folly of jumping around from method to method. Think of the Dharma as a mountain you must climb. There are many paths which lead to the summit. Choose one and stay with it! It will lead you there! But you will never get to the top if you race around the mountain trying one path and then rejecting it in favor of another that looks easier. You will circle the mountain many times, but you will never climb it. Stay with your chosen method. Be absolutely faithful to it.

So, regardless of whether you choose the path of Chan, Mantra, or Yantra, reciting Sutras or Breath Counting, or a Hua Tou, or repeating the Buddha's name, stay with your method! If it doesn't deliver you today, try again tomorrow. Tell yourself that you will be so determined that if you have to continue your practice in the next life, you will do so in order to succeed. Old Master Wei Shan used to say, ""Stay with your chosen practice. Take as many reincarnations as you need to attain Buddhahood.""     

I know it's easy to become discouraged when we think we're not making progress. We try and try but when enlightenment doesn't come we want to give up the struggle. Perseverance is itself an accomplishment.       

Be steadfast and patient. You're not alone in your struggle. According to ancient wisdom, ""We train for dreary eons - for enlightenment that occurs in a flashing instant.""

MA 76 is a constructed slightly differently than AN 8.63, especially in brahma vihara section,

but the themes of walking while doing sati, jhāna, and brahma vihāra are there.

And MA 76 is even more explicit and unequivocal about 4 jhānas being done simultaneously with satipaṭṭhāna in all 4 postures than AN 8.63.

# Conclusion

In [AN 3.63](https://lucid24.org/an/main/an03/index.html#3.63), Bhikkhu Sujato admits the Buddha is indeed walking WHILE in the four jhānas: [“one in such a state” while walking](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/one-in-such-a-state-while-walking/33344).  
He then goes on to dismiss AN 3.63 as a curiosity, exception to the rule of jhāna being a disembodied state with no thought, with no Agama Chinese parallel.  
But if you read AN 8.63 (above), you'll see that AN 3.63 is exactly the Buddha doing what his general instructions to all monks in AN 8.63 is talking about.  
So AN 3.63 is not just about the Buddha being happy, it's about the Buddha eating his own cooking, following his own instructions on walking and doing jhāna, satipaṭṭhāna, all at the same time. Just as he tells ALL the monks to do, not just an exceptional thing only Buddha can do.

they diminish like the waning moon.

When you’re in the habit of sleeping late,
seeing night as time to rise,
and always getting drunk,
you can’t keep up the household life.

also it is at times very painful because is shifted more upwards to my heart and feels very punctual and concentrated there...

and also it is a super physical feeling but at the same time is feels like it is my whole trauma bundled together.

My grandma also died like 8-9 months ago. It's nothing special she died after getting cancer treatment in the age of 83. We both are Buddhist believer, although we had different approaches.

Currently everything is supposed to be great. I found many friends in university and I'm quite popular I believe. I also have other friends from different places. Also the friendships are not only during class, we meet us after school and we make jokes and send memes etc. Everyone treats me with respect and very well. I should be happy right now, everything is like I wanted to be but I'm so sad and lonely when I get back. I hate it. I don't wanna live anymore and I feel like no one knows how brocken I am. They always say let go or stop caring so much. But I do care, I always did. I have no person who is down to earth and neutral and really listens to me. I don't care about politics and just because I was born in a chinese family doesn't mean I despise nor support anyone's politics. I hate when people asking me ""Israel or Palastine"" I hate to judge over people who I don't even know.  They treat this thing like a football match (Are you supporting Real Madrid or Manchester United?). I thought someone who was my closest friend for 11 years would understand me, but now he became a Christian fanatic and he answers with bible quotes. I always wanted to listen to his personal opinion and now he became an ambassador for his faith. I don't care what you believe just show me a little personality and vulnerability. I'm so hollow inside.  They are so opinionated and I can't. When I wake up there are tears on my face because I cried during sleep. I'm not strong, I don't wanna decide and I fear people leaving me here. They all believe I'm super confident but I'm not. Because I'm perhaps a little attractive and I speak Mandarin, German and English fluently they think I won't struggle with communication. I'm sick of these masks and fake persona I am involved with.

The happiness of endless beings, the treasure of gods and men, precious peace and wealth, these are the many grains of sand carried by your righteous path of peace like the Ganges river—may it envelop the entire earth in its embrace!

Competition arises from feelings of unworthiness and is tied to hostility, Ill will, and a lot of greed. When you achieve or attain or win, you are still stuck in the mindset of ""not good enough, need to win"" and you don't get a chance to relax in life or be with other people in a genuine way. It's the ego's need to prove itself to be real and worthy, or even superior. Even when someone is joking with competitiveness, there is an undertone of competition and seriousness, not real humor. There is tension there, and hostility. 

It's true that the guy who bullied you in school might be your boss one day, but it's also true that they're probably miserable inside. Competitiveness is like an addiction.

\[What we are today comes from our thoughts of yesterday, and our present thoughts build our life of tomorrow: our life is the creation of our mind. If a man speaks or acts with a pure mind, joy follows him as his own shadow.

{All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts with a pure thought, happiness follows him, like a shadow that never leaves him.

>All things have the nature of mind. Mind is the chief and takes the lead. If the mind is polluted, whatever you do or say leads to suffering which will follow you, as a cart trails a horse.



(“He abused me, he struck me, he overpowered me, he robbed me.” Those who harbor such thoughts do not still their hatred. “He abused me, he struck me, he overpowered me, he robbed me.” Those who do not harbor such thoughts still their hatred.

\[‘He insulted me, he hurt me, he defeated me, he robbed me.’ Those who think such thoughts will not be free from hate. ‘He insulted me, he hurt me, he defeated me, he robbed me.’ Those who think not such thoughts will be free from hate.

{He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,' - in those who harbour such thoughts hatred will never cease. ‘He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,'--in those who do not harbour such thoughts hatred will cease.

>Spoken in the fetavana Grove to Tilya: 'They would harm me. They would embarrass me. They would rob me. They would defeat me.' Those who think in such a way will never be released from their hatred. 'They would harm me. They would embarrass me. They would rob me. They would defeat me.' Those who do not think in such a way will be released from their hatred.



(Hatred is never appeased by hatred in this world. By non-hatred alone is hatred appeased. This is a law eternal. There are those who do not realize that one day we all must die. But those who do realize this settle their quarrels.

\[For hate is not conquered by hate: hate is conquered by love. This is a law eternal. Many do not know that we are here in this world to live in harmony. Those who know this do not fight against each other.

{For hatred does not cease by hatred at any time: hatred ceases by love, this is an old rule. The world does not know that we must all come to an end here;--but those who know it, their quarrels cease at once.

>Spoken to Kdli in the Jetavana Grove: Your enemies will never make peace in the face of hatred - it is the absence of hatred that leads to peace. This is an eternal truth. We are but guests visiting this world, though most do not know this. Those who see the real situation, no longer feel inclined to quarrel.



(Just as a storm throws down a weak tree, so does Mara overpower the man who lives for the pursuit of pleasures, who is uncontrolled in his senses, immoderate in eating, indolent, and dissipated.

\[He who lives only for pleasures, and whose soul is not in harmony, who considers not the food he eats, is idle and has not the power of virtue – such a man is moved by MARA, is moved by selfish temptations, even as a weak tree is shaken by the wind.

{He who lives looking for pleasures only, his senses uncontrolled, immoderate in his food, idle, and weak, Mâra (the tempter) will certainly overthrow him, as the wind throws down a weak tree.

>Spoken in Srdvasti concerning the Elder and Younger Kdla: Living for the pursuit of pleasure, senses endlessly stimulated, all appetites fed, undisciplined and lazy, you will be blown away by Mara, powerless, like a twig in a storm.



(Just as a storm cannot prevail against a rocky mountain, so Mara can never overpower the man who lives meditating on the impurities, who is controlled in his senses, moderate in eating, and filled with faith and earnest effort.

\[But he who lives not for pleasures, and whose soul is in self-harmony, who eats or fasts with moderation, and has faith and the power of virtue – this man is not moved by temptations, as a great rock is not shaken by the wind.

{He who lives without looking for pleasures, his senses well controlled, moderate in his food, faithful and strong, him Mâra will certainly not overthrow, any more than the wind throws down a rocky mountain.

>Aware of the unpleasant side of life, senses controlled and appetites contained, full of faith and effort, you are like a mountain of rock in a storm, and Mara cannot touch you.



(Whoever being depraved, devoid of self-control and truthfulness, should don the monk's yellow robe, he surely is not worthy of the robe. But whoever is purged of depravity, well-established in virtues and filled with self-control and truthfulness, he indeed is worthy of the yellow robe.

\[If a man puts on the pure yellow robe with a soul which is impure, without self-harmony and truth, he is not worthy of the holy robe. But he who is pure from sin and whose soul is strong in virtue, who has self-harmony and truth, he is worthy of the holy robe.

{He who wishes to put on the yellow dress without having cleansed himself from sin, who disregards temperance and truth, is unworthy of the yellow dress. But he who has cleansed himself from sin, is well grounded in all virtues, and regards also temperance and truth, he is indeed worthy of the yellow dress.

>Spoken in Srdvasti concerning Devadatta: One who wraps himself in the robes of a monk without first clearing away his worst defilements, one who lacks both self-restraint and truth, is unworthy of the saffron robes. One who holds tightly to self-discipline and clears away all inner pollution, one endowed with both discipline and truth, is worthy of the saffron robes.



(Those who mistake the unessential to be essential and the essential to be unessential, dwelling in wrong thoughts, never arrive at the essential. Those who know the essential to be essential and the unessential to be unessential, dwelling in right thoughts, do arrive at the essential.

\[Those who think the unreal is, and think the Real is not, they shall never reach the Truth, lost in the path of wrong thought. But those who know the Real is, and know the unreal is not, they shall indeed reach the Truth, safe on the path of right thought.

{They who imagine truth in untruth, and see untruth in truth, never arrive at truth, but follow vain desires. They who know truth in truth, and untruth in untruth, arrive at truth, and follow true desires.

>Spoken in the Bamboo Grove concerning Sanjaya: Seeing the meaningful as meaningless, and the meaningless as meaningful, one is capable only of falsehood and fiction, and will never arrive at true meaning. Seeing the meaningful as meaningful, and the meaningless as meaningless, one is capable of genuine understanding, and will gain the heart of meaning.



(Just as rain breaks through an ill-thatched house, so passion penetrates an undeveloped mind. Just as rain does not break through a well-thatched house, so passion never penetrates a well-developed mind.

\[Even as rain breaks through an ill-thatched house, passions will break through an ill-guarded mind. But even as rain breaks not through a well-thatched house, passions break not through a well-guarded mind.

{As rain breaks through an ill-thatched house, passion will break through an unreflecting mind. As rain does not break through a well-thatched house, passion will not break through a well-reflecting mind.

>Spoken to Nanda in Srdvast: Just as rain leaks into a house with a poorly-made roof, desire and attachment will seep into a house unprotected by meditative awareness. Just as rain does not enter a house with a well-made roof, desire and attachment do not enter a house protected by meditative awareness.



(The evil-doer grieves here and hereafter; he grieves in both the worlds. He laments and is afflicted, recollecting his own impure deeds. The doer of good rejoices here and hereafter; he rejoices in both the worlds. He rejoices and exults, recollecting his own pure deeds.

{The evil-doer suffers in this world, and he suffers in the next; he suffers in both. He suffers when he thinks of the evil he has done; he suffers more when going on the evil path.

(Much though he recites the sacred texts, but acts not accordingly, that heedless man is like a cowherd who only counts the cows of others — he does not partake of the blessings of the holy life. Little though he recites the sacred texts, but puts the Teaching into practice, forsaking lust, hatred, and delusion, with true wisdom and emancipated mind, clinging to nothing of this or any other world — he indeed partakes of the blessings of a holy life.

\[If a man speaks many holy words but he speaks and does not, this thoughtless man cannot enjoy the life of holiness: he is like a cowherd who counts the cows of his master. Whereas if a man speaks but a few holy words and yet he lives the life of those words, free from passion and hate and illusion – with right vision and a mind free, craving for nothing both now and hereafter – the life of this man is a life of holiness.

You have committed the ten evils, the five rebellious acts, the four heavy offences, the slandering of dharma, become the Icchantika, transgressing the precepts, upholding wrong views and other offences towards all the sages and mundane men.

答曰。諸佛教行數越塵沙。稟識機緣。隨情非一。譬如世間人眼可見可信者。如明能破闇。空能含有。地能載養。水能生潤。火能成壞。如此等事悉名待對之法。即目可見。千差萬別。

Answer: The teachings and practices of all the Buddhas are more than the sands and dustmotes. The potential of those with consciousness and their affinities are different in accord with their capacity. There is not only one type of people. For instance, in this worldly realm there are things that we can see and we can believe with our eyes. For example lights can chase away the darkness, emptiness is able to encompass all that exists, the ground gives support to all living beings and nurture their growths, the water moisturizes all living beings, the fire has the power of accomplishment and the power of destruction. All these matters are known as the dharma of duality. We can witness with our eyes and see the so many differences.

何況佛法不思議之力豈無種種益也。隨出一門者即出一煩惱門也。隨入一門者即入一解脫智慧門也。為此隨緣起行。各求解脫。汝何以乃將非有緣之要行。障惑於我  然我之所愛即是我有緣之行。即非汝所求。汝之所愛即是汝有緣之行。亦非我所求。是故各隨所樂而修其行者。必疾得解脫也。

行者當知。若欲學解。從凡至聖乃至佛果。一切無礙皆得學也。若欲學行者。必藉有緣之法。少用功勞。多得益也。

What is more with the Buddha Dharma which possesses the inconceivable strength, how can it be without all kinds of benefits? When we are able to exit one door, we are leaving one door of afflictions. When we can enter a door, we are entering the door of liberation, the door of wisdom. As such we practise in accord with our conditions and every one can seek liberation. So why are you trying to confuse me with the important practices which I do not have affinity and hinder me of my practice, and thus create delusion? Whatever that I like to practise is done so because it has affinity with me. My practice is not what you seek. Whatever that you like is the practice which has affinity with you. But it is not what I am seeking. That is why we just cultivate in accord with what we desire and we will surely obtain liberation swiftly.

All the cultivators should thus know. If you wish to understand the teachings, you should learn everything with no obstructions. This is true for the mundane men, the Sages until the attainment of Buddhahood. But if you want to learn a practice, you must rely on a dharma which has affinity with you. Then without much effort you will obtain the benefits.

又白一切往生人等。今更為行者說一譬喻守護信心。以防外邪異見之難。何者是也。

譬如有人欲向西行百千之里 。忽然中路見有二河。一是火河在南。二是水河在北。二河各闊百步。各深無底。南北無邊。正水火中間有一白道。可闊四五寸許。此道從東岸至西岸。亦長百步。其水波浪交過濕道。其火焰亦來燒道。水火相交常無休息。此人既至空曠迥處。更無人物。多有群賊惡獸。見此人單獨。競來欲殺此人。怖死直走向西。忽然見此大河。即自念言。Moreover, for the sake of all the people who wish to attain a rebirth, I will now give these cultivators an analogy to protect their faith so that they will be protected from the disasters of deviant evil views. What is the analogy?

For example, there is a man who desires to travel to the west for hundreds of thousand miles. Suddenly, in the middle of the journey he comes upon two rivers. In the south is the fire river while in the north is the water river. The width of each river is about a hundred steps but the depth is unfathomable. They extend to the infinity in the north and south. Amidst the fire and water, there is a white path which measures about four to five inches in width. This path extends from the eastern shore to the western shore at a distance of a hundred steps. The water from the wavy river often wets the path while the fire with its flames also burns up the path. The water and fire take turns to wet and burn the path, unceasingly. This man arrives at the remote wilderness where no one can be seen. But there are the gangs of robbers and ferocious animals which chase after him, competing to kill him when they found that he is alone. The man is so frightened that he runs to the west straight away. Suddenly he comes upon this great river and he is thus thinking,

此河南北不見邊畔。中間見一白道。極是狹小。二岸相去雖近。何由可行。今日定死不疑。正欲到迴群賊惡獸漸漸來逼。正欲南北避走惡獸毒蟲競來向我。正欲向西尋道而去。復恐墮此水火二河。當時惶怖不復可言。

即自思念。我今迴亦死。住亦死。去亦死。一種不勉死者。我寧尋此道向前而去。既有此道。必應可度。

作此念時。東岸忽聞人勸聲。仁者。但決定尋此道行。必無死難。若住即死。又西岸上有人喚言。汝一心正念直來。我能護汝。眾不畏墮於水火之難。此人既聞此遣彼喚。即自正當身心。決定尋道直進。不生疑怯退心。

‘I cannot see the shore of this river from the north to the south. The white path in the middle is extremely narrow. Even though the two shores are quite near but how am I going to travel on it? Today I will surely die. There is no doubt about this.’ As he is turning back, he sees the gangs of robbers and wild animals are approaching him, getting closer and closer. He wishes to escape them by travelling to the north south directions, the evil animals and poisonous insects compete to attack him. He wishes to run to the west following the path, but he hesitates as he is afraid to fall into the two rivers of water and fire. At that time his frights are unspeakable.

He is thus thinking, ‘If I turn back, I will die. If I stay put, I will also die. If I walk on, I will also die. Anyhow, I will die too. I decide to travel on this path and walk on. Since there is the path, I might have a chance to cross over.’

After thinking thus, in the eastern shore someone is encouraging to walk on, ‘Humane One, be resolute to travel on this path.  you will be free from the disaster of death. If you stay put you will just die here.’ Then in the western shore he hears a voice calling out to him, ‘You just walk on single-mindedly with right mindfulness. I am able to protect you. Do not be afraid that you will not fall into the disaster of fire and water.’ On hearing this exhortation and the call, this man brings forth mindfulness in body and mind. He decides to walk on without doubts, frights or a retreating mind.  

或行一分二分。東岸群賊等喚言。仁者迴來。此道嶮惡不得過必死不疑。我等眾無惡心相向。此人雖聞喚聲。亦不迴顧。一心直進念道而行。須臾即到西岸。永離諸難。善友相見。慶樂無已。此是喻也。

After walking one or two steps and he hears the gangs of robbers in the eastern shore shouting at him, ‘Humane One, do come back. This road is dangerous and full of disasters. There is no doubt you will fall to your death. We are not unkind and we will not harm you, anyway.’ On hearing this, he does not turn back but continues to walk on the white path single-mindedly, with mindfulness. After a short while he arrives at the western shore. He is forever free from all disasters. He meets with all his good friends and they rejoice greatly. This is the analogy.

次合喻者。言東岸者即喻此娑婆之火宅也。言西岸者即喻極樂寶國也。言群賊惡獸詐親者即喻眾生六根六識六塵五陰四大也。言無人空迥澤者即喻常隨惡友不值真善知識也。言水火二河者即喻眾生貪愛如水瞋憎如火也。言中間白道四五寸者。即喻眾生貪瞋煩惱中能生清淨願往生心也。

Next, we will explain the analogy. The eastern shore refers to this Saha world, the house which is on fire. The Western shore is the analogy of the Jewel Land of Ultimate Bliss. The gangs of robbers and ferocious animals who pretended to be our friends are the analogies of the six roots of living beings, the six consciousness, the six dusts, the five skandhas and the four elements. A remote wilderness refers to the situation when we often follow the evil friends, that we have not met with the genuine good advisers.  The two rivers of fire and water refer to the greedy loving desire of living beings which resembles the water, the anger and hatred that resemble the fire. The white path in the middle of the rivers which is about four to five inches carries the meaning that in the midst of living beings’ greed and loving attachment that resemble the water, the anger and hatred that resemble the fire, the pure vows of attaining a rebirth can come forth.

乃由貪瞋強故即喻如水火。善心微故。喻如白道。又水波常濕道者。即喻愛心常起。能染污善心也。又火焰常燒道者。即喻瞋嫌之心能燒功德之法財也。言人行道上直向西者。即喻迴諸行業直向西方也。言東岸聞人聲勸遣尋道直西進者。即喻釋迦已滅後人不見。由有教法可尋。即喻之如聲也。言或行一分二分群賊等喚迴者。即喻別解別行惡見人等妄說見解迭相惑亂。及自造罪退失也。言西岸上有人喚者。即喻彌陀願意也。言須臾到西岸善友相見喜者。即喻眾生久沈生死。曠劫淪迴迷倒自纏。無由解脫。仰蒙釋迦發遣指向西方。又藉彌陀悲心招喚。今信順二尊之意。不顧水火二河。念念無遺。乘彼願力之道。捨命已後得生彼國。與佛相見。慶喜何極也。

As the greed and hatred are so strong, they resemble the water and fire. As there is so little good mind the white path is taken as the analogy. Moreover, the water waves often wet the path shows that we often give rise to a mind of loving desire. This will defile our good mind. The fire often burns the path is the analogy that we often dwell in anger and complain that they will burn up the dharma wealth of merits and virtues. Saying the man who walks straight on the path to the west is the analogy of the transference of all our karmas in practice to the west. Hearing the voice of someone in the eastern shore who exhorts us to follow the path to travel to the west is the analogy of Sakaymuni Buddha who has entered still extinction. We cannot see the Buddha but his Dharma teaching is still dwelling in the world. This is the analogy of his voice. The taking of one step or two steps, the calls of the gangs of robbers and others are the analogy of other explanation, other practices of men with evil views. They falsely teach their views and understanding to confuse the practitioners, committing the offences that lead to a retreat in the practice. The man in the western shore who calls out is the analogy of Amitabha Buddha’s Vows and his wishes to rescue us. Saying that we will arrive at the Western Shore in a short while and our joys to see our good friends is the analogy that living beings have been drown in the seas of birth and death for too long. Throughout the long kalpas they have sunken in the seas of transmigration because they are bound in their inverted thought and upside-down views. There is no way for them to attain liberation. Now by relying on Sakyamuni Buddha’s exhortation to point out to us the Western Land, and the calls of the Compassionate Amitabha Buddha, now we believe and have faith in the wish of the two Honoured Ones. We no longer care about the rivers of water and fire as in every mindfulness we will rely solely on the path, that is the strength of Vows of Amitabha Buddha. After passing away we will be born in that Land to see the Buddha. What a great joy it would be for us!

又一切行者行住坐臥三業所修。無問晝夜時節。常作此解。常作此想。故名迴向發願心。又言迴向者。生彼國已還起大悲。迴入生死教化眾生。亦名迴向也。三心既具。無行不成。願行既成若不生者。無有是處也。

Besides all the cultivators will keep this teaching in mind, visualizing this teaching while they are walking, standing, sitting or lying down, while they are conducting themselves in the three karmas of body, mouth and mind, without considering the time, season, day or nights. So, this is known as the mind of transference, the mind of bringing forth the vows. Moreover, those who have transferred the merits to be born in that Land will again bring forth the mind of Great Compassion after the rebirth in that Land. They will come back to the realm of birth and death to teach and transform all living beings. This is also known as transference. As we are replete with the three minds, all our practices can be accomplished. Since the vows and practices are accomplished, it is impossible not to attain a rebirth.

又此三心亦通攝定善之義。應知。

Moreover these three minds can also be used to explain the meaning of wholesomeness in Samadhi. We should thus know.Question: If people of other practices with their different views, with their evil views in mixed practices create confusion in our practice by talking on all kinds of doubts and difficulties, telling us we cannot attain a rebirth. Or they say, ‘All of you living beings have created the karma with your body, mouth and mind throughout the long Kalpas until this life. You have committed the ten evils, the five rebellious acts, the four heavy offences, the slandering of dharma, become the Icchantika, transgressing the precepts, upholding wrong views and other offences towards all the sages and mundane men. You have not cleared all your sins. All these offences will bind you to the triple realm, the evil paths. So, how can you just by cultivating the blessings and reciting the Buddha’s Name in one life enable you to enter the Land of No birth, the land which is free from leakage and you will forever be certified and enlightened to the positions of non-retreating?’

答曰。諸佛教行數越塵沙。稟識機緣。隨情非一。譬如世間人眼可見可信者。如明能破闇。空能含有。地能載養。水能生潤。火能成壞。如此等事悉名待對之法。即目可見。千差萬別。

This is true for the mundane men, the Sages until the attainment of Buddhahood. But if you want to learn a practice, you must rely on a dharma which has affinity with you. Then without much effort you will obtain the benefits.

又白一切往生人等。今更為行者說一譬喻守護信心。以防外邪異見之難。何者是也。

譬如有人欲向西行百千之里 。忽然中路見有二河。一是火河在南。二是水河在北。二河各闊百步。各深無底。南北無邊。正水火中間有一白道。可闊四五寸許。此道從東岸至西岸。亦長百步。其水波浪交過濕道。其火焰亦來燒道。水火相交常無休息。此人既至空曠迥處。更無人物。多有群賊惡獸。見此人單獨。競來欲殺此人。怖死直走向西。忽然見此大河。即自念言。Moreover, for the sake of all the people who wish to attain a rebirth, I will now give these cultivators an analogy to protect their faith so that they will be protected from the disasters of deviant evil views. What is the analogy?

For example, there is a man who desires to travel to the west for hundreds of thousand miles. Suddenly, in the middle of the journey he comes upon two rivers. In the south is the fire river while in the north is the water river. The width of each river is about a hundred steps but the depth is unfathomable. They extend to the infinity in the north and south. Amidst the fire and water, there is a white path which measures about four to five inches in width. This path extends from the eastern shore to the western shore at a distance of a hundred steps. The water from the wavy river often wets the path while the fire with its flames also burns up the path. The water and fire take turns to wet and burn the path, unceasingly. This man arrives at the remote wilderness where no one can be seen. But there are the gangs of robbers and ferocious animals which chase after him, competing to kill him when they found that he is alone. The man is so frightened that he runs to the west straight away. Suddenly he comes upon this great river and he is thus thinking,

此河南北不見邊畔。中間見一白道。極是狹小。二岸相去雖近。何由可行。今日定死不疑。正欲到迴群賊惡獸漸漸來逼。正欲南北避走惡獸毒蟲競來向我。正欲向西尋道而去。復恐墮此水火二河。當時惶怖不復可言。

即自思念。我今迴亦死。住亦死。去亦死。一種不勉死者。我寧尋此道向前而去。既有此道。必應可度。

作此念時。東岸忽聞人勸聲。仁者。但決定尋此道行。必無死難。若住即死。又西岸上有人喚言。汝一心正念直來。我能護汝。眾不畏墮於水火之難。此人既聞此遣彼喚。即自正當身心。決定尋道直進。不生疑怯退心。

‘I cannot see the shore of this river from the north to the south. The white path in the middle is extremely narrow. Even though the two shores are quite near but how am I going to travel on it? Today I will surely die. There is no doubt about this.’ As he is turning back, he sees the gangs of robbers and wild animals are approaching him, getting closer and closer. He wishes to escape them by travelling to the north south directions, the evil animals and poisonous insects compete to attack him. He wishes to run to the west following the path, but he hesitates as he is afraid to fall into the two rivers of water and fire. At that time his frights are unspeakable.

He is thus thinking, ‘If I turn back, I will die. If I stay put, I will also die. If I walk on, I will also die. Anyhow, I will die too. I decide to travel on this path and walk on. Since there is the path, I might have a chance to cross over.’

After thinking thus, in the eastern shore someone is encouraging to walk on, ‘Humane One, be resolute to travel on this path.  you will be free from the disaster of death. If you stay put you will just die here.’ Then in the western shore he hears a voice calling out to him, ‘You just walk on single-mindedly with right mindfulness. I am able to protect you. Do not be afraid that you will not fall into the disaster of fire and water.’ On hearing this exhortation and the call, this man brings forth mindfulness in body and mind. He decides to walk on without doubts, frights or a retreating mind.  

或行一分二分。東岸群賊等喚言。仁者迴來。此道嶮惡不得過必死不疑。我等眾無惡心相向。此人雖聞喚聲。亦不迴顧。一心直進念道而行。須臾即到西岸。永離諸難。善友相見。慶樂無已。此是喻也。

After walking one or two steps and he hears the gangs of robbers in the eastern shore shouting at him, ‘Humane One, do come back. This road is dangerous and full of disasters. There is no doubt you will fall to your death. We are not unkind and we will not harm you, anyway.’ On hearing this, he does not turn back but continues to walk on the white path single-mindedly, with mindfulness. After a short while he arrives at the western shore. He is forever free from all disasters. He meets with all his good friends and they rejoice greatly. This is the analogy.

次合喻者。言東岸者即喻此娑婆之火宅也。言西岸者即喻極樂寶國也。言群賊惡獸詐親者即喻眾生六根六識六塵五陰四大也。言無人空迥澤者即喻常隨惡友不值真善知識也。言水火二河者即喻眾生貪愛如水瞋憎如火也。言中間白道四五寸者。即喻眾生貪瞋煩惱中能生清淨願往生心也。

Next, we will explain the analogy. The eastern shore refers to this Saha world, the house which is on fire. The Western shore is the analogy of the Jewel Land of Ultimate Bliss. The gangs of robbers and ferocious animals who pretended to be our friends are the analogies of the six roots of living beings, the six consciousness, the six dusts, the five skandhas and the four elements. A remote wilderness refers to the situation when we often follow the evil friends, that we have not met with the genuine good advisers.  The two rivers of fire and water refer to the greedy loving desire of living beings which resembles the water, the anger and hatred that resemble the fire. The white path in the middle of the rivers which is about four to five inches carries the meaning that in the midst of living beings’ greed and loving attachment that resemble the water, the anger and hatred that resemble the fire, the pure vows of attaining a rebirth can come forth.

乃由貪瞋強故即喻如水火。善心微故。喻如白道。又水波常濕道者。即喻愛心常起。能染污善心也。又火焰常燒道者。即喻瞋嫌之心能燒功德之法財也。言人行道上直向西者。即喻迴諸行業直向西方也。言東岸聞人聲勸遣尋道直西進者。即喻釋迦已滅後人不見。由有教法可尋。即喻之如聲也。言或行一分二分群賊等喚迴者。即喻別解別行惡見人等妄說見解迭相惑亂。及自造罪退失也。言西岸上有人喚者。即喻彌陀願意也。言須臾到西岸善友相見喜者。即喻眾生久沈生死。曠劫淪迴迷倒自纏。無由解脫。仰蒙釋迦發遣指向西方。又藉彌陀悲心招喚。今信順二尊之意。不顧水火二河。念念無遺。乘彼願力之道。捨命已後得生彼國。與佛相見。慶喜何極也。

As the greed and hatred are so strong, they resemble the water and fire. As there is so little good mind the white path is taken as the analogy. Moreover, the water waves often wet the path shows that we often give rise to a mind of loving desire. This will defile our good mind. The fire often burns the path is the analogy that we often dwell in anger and complain that they will burn up the dharma wealth of merits and virtues. Saying the man who walks straight on the path to the west is the analogy of the transference of all our karmas in practice to the west. Hearing the voice of someone in the eastern shore who exhorts us to follow the path to travel to the west is the analogy of Sakaymuni Buddha who has entered still extinction. We cannot see the Buddha but his Dharma teaching is still dwelling in the world. This is the analogy of his voice. The taking of one step or two steps, the calls of the gangs of robbers and others are the analogy of other explanation, other practices of men with evil views. They falsely teach their views and understanding to confuse the practitioners, committing the offences that lead to a retreat in the practice. The man in the western shore who calls out is the analogy of Amitabha Buddha’s Vows and his wishes to rescue us. Saying that we will arrive at the Western Shore in a short while and our joys to see our good friends is the analogy that living beings have been drown in the seas of birth and death for too long. Throughout the long kalpas they have sunken in the seas of transmigration because they are bound in their inverted thought and upside-down views. There is no way for them to attain liberation. Now by relying on Sakyamuni Buddha’s exhortation to point out to us the Western Land, and the calls of the Compassionate Amitabha Buddha, now we believe and have faith in the wish of the two Honoured Ones. We no longer care about the rivers of water and fire as in every mindfulness we will rely solely on the path, that is the strength of Vows of Amitabha Buddha. After passing away we will be born in that Land to see the Buddha. What a great joy it would be for us!

又一切行者行住坐臥三業所修。無問晝夜時節。常作此解。常作此想。故名迴向發願心。又言迴向者。生彼國已還起大悲。迴入生死教化眾生。亦名迴向也。三心既具。無行不成。願行既成若不生者。無有是處也。

Besides all the cultivators will keep this teaching in mind, visualizing this teaching while they are walking, standing, sitting or lying down, while they are conducting themselves in the three karmas of body, mouth and mind, without considering the time, season, day or nights. So, this is known as the mind of transference, the mind of bringing forth the vows. Moreover, those who have transferred the merits to be born in that Land will again bring forth the mind of Great Compassion after the rebirth in that Land. They will come back to the realm of birth and death to teach and transform all living beings. This is also known as transference. As we are replete with the three minds, all our practices can be accomplished. Since the vows and practices are accomplished, it is impossible not to attain a rebirth.

又此三心亦通攝定善之義。應知。

Moreover these three minds can also be used to explain the meaning of wholesomeness in Samadhi. We should thus know.

Longer read :



I've been having a lot of inner tension / pain which I would like to explore and share and would welcome any advice. 



Basically, I feel a bit trapped by learning about Buddhism (I know this is an immature assessment and I don't intend any actual offense against the religion/philosophy, I'm just a bit jumbled up) - it's given me this wonderful understanding of the futility of the cravings we prop ourselves up on, and the way they perpetuate an endless cycle of clinging and suffering and repetitiveness; how we seek out silly vices to make our inner world feel okay rather than simply being with our feelings and abiding in the understanding that everything is impermenant, insubstantial/ non-self, and unsatisfying/ suffering. 



For me, my main vices of craving are cigarettes, alcohol, and emotional eating. 



However, I don't have (or at least, don't demonstrate) the courage and discipline to actually act on this understanding consistently. When things get hard it still feels so uncomfortable inside that I find myself falling back into these unskillful patterns of thought and behavior, but now added on to it is the knowledge of not just their futility but their contribution to the very suffering I'm feeling so discomforted by. 



In other words, I feel like I've lost that naive, intoxicating comfort of indulging cravings; I'm still trapped by their existence, but feel even more spiritually burdened (almost guilty) by my inability to resist them, and don't have the courage to take the actions required to actually work past them. 



Actually quitting cigarettes and alcohol and not emotionally eating would be such a change in my way of life and social circles that I don't feel ready to stop them, but I feel in even more discomfort than before I realized how hapless my approach to dealing with life is. 



Has anyone experienced any similar sorts of inner confusion or tension around stuff like this? Any advice from those who have worked through it? Still working through it? Any advice appreciated 



Much metta and appreciation x

Everything in saṃsāra and nirvāṇa that can possibly appear  
has a single ground, two paths, and two results—  
the miraculous displays of awareness and unawareness.  
Through the aspiration prayer of Samantabhadra,  
may all awaken in a fully perfect manner  
in the palace of the dharmadhātu.  


The ground of all is unconditioned—  
the self-arising, inexpressible, vast spaciousness  
without the names “saṃsāra” or “nirvāṇa.”  
The awareness of just this is buddhahood;  
unaware, sentient beings wander in saṃsāra.  
May all beings of the three realms  
be aware of the reality of the inexpressible ground.

I, Samantabhadra,  
am aware that this very reality of the ground  
without causes and conditions is self-arising within the ground,  
unaffected by the flaws of outer and inner, superimposition and denial,  
and untainted by the stains of the darkness of mindlessness.  
Therefore, self-appearances are not blemished by any flaws.  
Within self-awareness resting in its seat,  
there is no fear, even if the threefold existence is destroyed,  
nor is there attachment to the five sense pleasures.  
In nonconceptual self-arising mind,  
neither solid forms nor the five poisons exist.

The unceasing dimension of awareness’s lucidity  
is of a single essence and yet displays as five wisdoms.  
The five original buddha families spring forth  
from the maturation of these five wisdoms.  
Through wisdom’s fully unfolding from that,  
the forty-two buddhas originate.  
Through the dawning of the dynamic energy of the five wisdoms,  
the sixty blood-drinkers come to life.  
Therefore, ground awareness is never deluded.  
Since I am the original buddha,  
through my aspiration prayer,  
may all sentient beings cycling through the three realms  
recognize the face of self-arising awareness  
and fully unfold great wisdom.

My emanations form an unceasing stream,  
unfurling as inconceivable billions  
and displaying as a vast array of suitable guidance.  
Through my compassionate aspiration prayer,  
may all sentient beings cycling through the three realms  
leave the six kinds of existence behind.

At first, since deluded sentient beings  
do not dawn as awareness in the ground,  
they are absolutely mindless and oblivious.  
Exactly that is unawareness, the cause of delusion.  
From within that vacuous swoon,  
a fearful vague cognizance stirs.  
From that, self and others as well as enmity arise.  
Through the gradual blossoming of latent tendencies,  
saṃsāra unfolds, taking its natural course.  
Due to that, the five poisons of the afflictions flourish  
and their karmas become an incessant flow.  
Thus, the ground of sentient beings’ delusion  
is mindless unawareness.  
Hence, through this aspiration prayer of myself, the buddha,  
may all recognize awareness itself.

Connate unawareness  
is mindless oblivious cognizance.  
Imaginative unawareness  
is the clinging to the duality of self and other.  
This twofold connate and imaginative unawareness  
is the ground of delusion of all sentient beings.  
Through this aspiration prayer of myself, the buddha,  
may all sāṃsaric sentient beings’  
darkness of dull mindlessness be dispelled,  
their mind of dualistic clinging be translucent,  
and their awareness recognize its own face.

The mind of dualistic clinging is doubt:  
from the arising of subtle fixation,  
dense latent tendencies gradually unfold.  
Be it food, wealth, clothing, places, companions,  
the five sense pleasures, or beloved relatives,  
we are tormented by our attachment to what seems attractive.  
These are mundane delusions:  
the karmas of perceiver and perceived are never exhausted.  
When the results of clinging ripen,  
we are born as hungry ghosts tortured by craving—  
how pitiful is our hunger and thirst!  
Through this aspiration prayer of myself, the buddha,  
may sentient beings full of attachment and clinging  
neither cast out the torment of desire  
nor welcome the craving of attachment,  
but may awareness take its very seat  
through letting mind relax in its own state  
and may discriminating wisdom be attained.

A subtle mind of fear stirs  
around the appearance of external objects.  
Thus, the unfolding of hatred’s latent tendencies  
leads to powerful enmity, beating, and killing.  
When the results of hatred ripen,  
oh, how we suffer through being boiled and burned in hell!  
Through this aspiration prayer of myself, the buddha,  
when fierce hatred flares up  
in all sentient beings of the six realms,  
may it relax in its own state without adopting or rejecting,  
may awareness take its own seat,  
and may lucid wisdom be attained.

Our own mind being haughty,  
it vies with others and puts them down.  
Through the arising of intense pride,  
we experience the suffering of fighting and struggling with others.  
When the results of those actions ripen,  
we are born as a god experiencing transition and downfall.  
Through this aspiration prayer of myself, the buddha,  
when sentient beings give rise to such haughtiness,  
may they let their mind relax in its own state,  
may awareness take its very own seat,  
and may the wisdom of equality be realized.

Triggered by the latent tendencies of rampant dualistic clinging,  
the competitive mind of fighting and struggling blossoms  
from the pain of praising ourselves and disparaging others.  
Being thus reborn in the asura realm of killing and slashing,  
we take a deep plunge into the realms of hell.  
Through this aspiration prayer of myself, the buddha,  
when a competitive mind, fighting, and struggling dawn,  
may we not entertain enmity but let it relax in its own place,  
may mind take its very own seat,  
and may the wisdom of unimpeded enlightened activity be.

Mindlessless, indifference, distraction,  
obtuseness, dullness, forgetfulness,  
unconsciousness, laziness, and bewilderment  
result in roaming as animals without any shelter.  
Through this aspiration prayer of myself, the buddha,  
may the radiance of lucid mindfulness shine  
in the darkness of our bewildered dullness  
and may nonconceptual wisdom be attained.

All sentient beings of the three realms  
are equal to myself, the buddha, the ground of all,  
but for them it became the ground of mindless delusion.  
Right now, they engage in meaningless activities,  
with the six kinds of karma being like delusions in a dream.  
I, however, am the primordial buddha.  
In order to guide the six kinds of beings through emanations,  
through this aspiration prayer of Samantabhadra,  
may all sentient beings without exception  
become awakened in the dharmadhātu.

A HO  
From now on, whenever mighty yogic practitioners  
make this powerful aspiration prayer  
within self-luminous awareness free of delusion,  
all sentient beings who hear it  
will fully awaken within three lives.

During solar or lunar eclipses,  
when clamor or earthquakes happen,  
at the solstices, or at the turn of the year,  
if we let ourselves arise as Samantabhadra  
and recite this prayer within the hearing of all,  
through the aspiration of us yogic practitioners,  
all sentient beings of the three realms  
will gradually become free from suffering  
and then swiftly attain buddhahood.

This is the nineteenth chapter from *The Tantra that Teaches the Great Perfection as Samantabhadra’s Unobstructed Awakened Mind*, which teaches that through making this powerful aspiration prayer, all sentient beings cannot help but awaken.

Before I continue, I would like to acknowledge first and foremost that I recognize Buddhism as a philosophy more than a religion and am not seeking to pit one against the other here. 

I am struggling with my views on the Christianity I once acknowledged, particularly Catholicism. Even more particular, traditionalism. I came from a culture that was heavy on understanding the faith down to the pixel. We were encouraged to study apologetics, to pray the rosary often, to go to confession often, to seek to know God even closer. My problem is, I've had a fundamental problem with the teaching on homosexuality on a personal level as I am gay. I've fought with it for years and tried to ""deny myself"" as I've been advised, but I always felt like my humanity was being diminished. Cutting to the end and to my present day, I have always felt close to this belief that I am intimately close to the universe and would do well to acknowledge my part in the bigger picture. In Christianity we were taught to deny the world and keep our eyes towards God, which without certain ""training"" I would see as dangerous and susceptible to neuroticism (or in religious terms, scrupulosity). I wish to learn more about Buddhism because I find religion hard to hold up and what the Buddha has taught, from what I've gathered, involves stepping outside of devotion and worship to acknowledging simple truths about the universe and putting ourselves in line with them. 

I realize I'm going on a bit of a ramble, but I'm curious if there are other people in a similar place as me; i.e. those who understood their previous religious apologetics and have found them untenable and moved towards stepping away from religion to focus on the simple truths of the universe.

I just wanted to share how I feel, and hear your perspectives.

— It turned out a bit long, so I divided it into sub topics —

**My background:**

I've been meditating for 5-6 years but have maintained a regular practice for the last two (1-2 hours a day). Attended three 10-day Vipassana courses (going for a 4th to serve in May).

For about 6 months now or so, I've been feeling that my solo practice is no longer sufficient. I feel such a strong calling to connect with a teacher and receive guidance, and to practice in a sangha that sometimes it's hard to sit still, and it sometimes makes me cry when I meditate.

I've been learning from a Nepalese Rinpoche for some time, but then I was warned against him and out of fear of potential abuse (was planning to go to stay in his monastery in Nepal), I disengaged from him, and felt pretty lost practice-wise since.

**Search for the teacher and sangha:**

I tried reaching out to meditation centres in my country, in neighbouring countries (I'm from Europe) and in the States too, but either didn't get a response or they weren't able to accommodate me. I'm interested in Zen or Dzogchen (but pretty open to other paths if a teacher decides some is better for me than the other).

A bit of additional context: I have a boyfriend, we are in a LDR but working to get him a long-term visa to Europe. I also have a dog. For those two reasons, I don't feel like I could commit to a monastic life at this point, although it does pass my head from time to time. That also makes me feel a bit hesitant to continue committing to my relationship, even though I love my partner.

Rather, for now, I'd like to see if I can stay with a teacher somewhere for a month or a few. Ideally, I would still be able to work from my computer as I'm afraid to put my job at risk in the present market situation and with AI looming over us. I'd also prefer to go with my dog, even if that would mean staying outside of the centre but in close proximity and attending teachings and group practice. I know these are unusual, but I've seen some meditation centres accepting such circumstances, so I got an idea that perhaps it could be possible. But, of course, I am willing to consider any option.

**Aimlessness & the need for like-minded people**

The more I meditate, the more ""aimless"" I feel, in a sense that it is becoming increasingly difficult for me to find interest in most of the things people around me occupy themselves with (romantic relationships, buying apartments, growing families, clothes and gadgets, starting businesses, traveling, etc.). Those things used to be appealing to me, now, more often than not, as soon as I try engaging in them, I already see the emptiness of them, and so it feel pointless and like a waste of time and energy. I suppose it is just an outdated story of my mind, that's not yet adapted to the reality of my deeper mind. But still, the thing is, I don't know how else to be where I am now, with the people that surround me.

I’ve been doing some contemplating about buddhist philosophic concepts, and I’m a little confused. I was hoping some of you might be able to clarify whether I’m misunderstanding things.

So, I understand that Buddhism believes that all things are impermanent, however I also see the world in a dualistic lens, and because of this I believe there is actual permanence in the world. I’ve come to believe from personal experience that such a thing is the Buddhist concept of “mindstream”. 

Mindstream is the only thing in which I’ve personally observed permanent continuity in my lived experience, so I conclude that it seems likely that it is permanent. Whether I’m asleep and dreaming, groggy throughout the day, or on drugs, my mindstream is always there. It’s like a tunnel which I always experience, though the contents of the tunnel does greatly vary. I can also easily imagine that once I die, my thoughts, feelings, and consciousness die as well, but my mindstream permanently persists onto its next reincarnation journey. 

I’ve been debating ChatGPT that mindstream in Buddhism should be considered permanent, however ChatGPT says that Buddhism considers mindstream as a “process”, and processes don’t count as permanent. This explanation has been quite unsatisfactory to me, and this is why I’m asking for help and is the impetus for my post.

I can understand that “emptiness” is not permanent because emptiness is a lack of essence. I wouldn’t say a human that is not an apple, lacks apple-ness, and this lack of apple-ness is permanent. This is not true because it’s possible that the atoms of a human could over great time reconfigure into an apple. So a lack of something does not mean permanence.

But mindstream is different because it is something real and observable and has seemingly definite continuity. I can observe and be self aware of my own mindstream, and my mindstream can observe other people experiencing their mindstreams. It’s a real thing.

Also, I’ve been additionally frustrated with the seeming arbitrary distinctions made between Buddhism and Vedanta in regard to a permanent soul. ChatGPT says Vedanta claims there is a permanent soul which grows/evolves, and Buddhism claims there is no permanent soul. Isn’t this just an issue with semantics? Can’t Buddhism say Vedanta is correct that there is a permanent soul that grows, which in buddhist language would be the permanent mindstream that processes impermanent karma?

I have some questions regarding death, rebirth and hell for a school project. I would really appreciate it if anyone could answer to some of the things that you know an answer/ explanation to, and if it's something that is a common belief amongst all buddhists, or if it's a part of the teachings of a specific denomination.

From what I've heard, buddhist hell is not a place where beings are doomed to stay forever once they get there. Is that true? 

From what I have understood, hell is a realm where you can be reborn in after death. If it is not a place where you will stay permanently, is it possible to die in hell? How does one get out of hell?

Is it only possible for humans to get to hell?

Do buddhists believe that there will be a doomsday? If so, please give me short explanation.

reincarnation has always made the most sense to me, but i’ve always been a bit of an omnist (or universalist? not sure of the right word..) in a sense that i believed Christian’s version of enlightenment would be their idea of heaven, if they had generated lots of good karma through wholesome/compassion actions through their faith, same for muslims or other religious traditions involving an afterlife. 

what do you guys think of that idea? 

i know this is certainly not a Buddhist teaching, nor is reincarnation a Christian teaching at all. but to me, it makes sense and i guess this is my thought process in this position where i am trying to figure out which Buddhist teachings are compatible with Christianity 

what are your thoughts on this sort of syncretism of beliefs? 

i am looking into some of Thich Nhat Hanh’s books on this, such as “Living Buddha, Living Christ”. i remember reading something from him in which he talked about meeting a Catholic nun in a Buddhist monastery who said Buddhism made her a better Christian, which i found interesting and inspiring.

Joshu went to a hermit's hut and asked, ""Anyobdy in? Anybody in?"" The hermit thrust up his fist. Joshu said, ""The water is too shallow for a ship to anchor."" Thereupon he left.

Again he went to a hermit's hut and asked, ""Anybody in? Anybody in?"" The hermit, too, thrust up his fist. Joshu said, ""Freely you give, freely you take away. Freely you kill, freely you give life,"" He made a profound bow.

.....

The Verse:

*His eye is a shooting star,*

*His activity like lightning;*

*A sword kills man,*

*A sword that gives man life.*

If I am hungry and buy a pasty, and then the pasty is taken from me by a seagull, this might cause me distress.

But my distress comes from the belief that the pasty is mine and so cannot be denied to me. The seagull has no concept of ownership, it was just hungry and saw food and so took the food. My belief that the pasty was mine is a delusion, and it lead to the delusion that the seagull did me wrong by taking the pasty.

If I remove my conception of the pasty being mine, and I simply had a pasty that was then taken from me by a bird, it no longer feels like I have been wronged in some way. By removing the delusion, I remove the harm.

The problem is, this is very hard to do in the moment. If I haven’t already reflected on the delusion of ownership before the pasty is taken by the bird, in the moment my gut response is likely to be a combination of negative emotions.

my dad has always been the one to go out and war with them and kill as many as possible everyday. i can thoroughly smell raid spray just by thinking about it because my dad quite literally sprayed it every night. & throw boiling water on them too. and still they never went away. 

now i am at a point where the situation is getting worse in my current household (tho thankfully not to the extent of other places ive lived at) and we have exterminators hired by the landlord who come often, but theres more now. 

i have a toddler son now and the other day he caught one and he grabbed it with his fingers and said “hi bug” and it died right on his hands and i had to clean him right away. a next time i made a meal for us and they got to his plate before he could. i know they carry germs and my son explores the whole house all the time too and essentially i just don’t want him to be followed by roaches everywhere he goes. i was pretty healthy growing up; i am not sure how much living amongst them affected my heath but that doesnt mean i wanna risk it with my son either so i feel i should work to get rid of them.  full circle moment; i am now my dad except i dont want to be so brutal.

 a part of me says i should go full annihaltor mode but i have always read of buddhist monks who’d go the extra mile to not kill even the smallest of insects and something about intenionally killing every roach when they probably wouldnt makes me wonder if  its even absolutely necessary? i do want them to get out of my apartment because they were not here when i moved in but now i run into them every day and theyre getting in my cereal 💔. and my son!!! 

it feels weird asking this when anyone irl would look at me like i was crazy for wanting to spare a roaches life 😆. but i wanna minimize casualties at least…

I think it's easy to want to, in revering the Buddha, imagine he had some perfect conviction, free from fear and worry. I wonder if that is even possible. If he wasn't, just like many of us, horrified at the true nature of the world - horrified at how much pain humanity was in. 

  
It's what drew me so close to the story of the Buddha. Maybe it's the most relatable story ever told. We all lose the rose-colored glasses of childhood; we all have to figure out what life really is sooner or later. If we imagine the Buddha as stalwart and unaffected by his horrifying epiphany, maybe we might lose sight of the Buddha inside of us. We could forget the horror of that moment of pure compassion for the suffering earth, and all the pain that comes with accepting that you are just not powerful enough to stop it. 

  
We all have a choice in how much we choose to acknowledge how much pain the world is in, and just how much we choose to feel. I think Buddhists, even if we don't do this ourselves, worship the one who takes the burden of the world on his shoulders. I'm reminded of this sometimes when I find myself getting upset at something trivial. 

  
When I think about the story of Siddhartha, this moment of realization seems to me a moment of terror. A world's worth of pain falling onto the unblemished spirit of a man up until now blinded by wealth (though out of his control). I feel like it's worth remembering that.

I have been practicing Buddhism and vipassana far more seriously the past few months; Buddhism seems incredibly pragmatic and logical to me across most of its teachings.

However, I am still working to cultivate right view and have not fully accepted rebirth; I have some faith in the Buddha's teachings considering how logical they have been up to the point of rebirth.

This dilemma would not be too relevant or concerning if not for how it changes moral proceedings dealing with embodied sufferings such as chronic illnesses, accidental pregnancies, or sexual assaults.

If I am wrong about rebirth and I deny a person not only the right to but also *access and assistance* with euthanasia, I may be prolonging intense suffering. I am making a gamble that rebirth does occur rather than a complete cessation of sensual experience; in the event I am wrong I am contributing to substantial suffering.

Likewise, regarding abortion, there are mountains of literature supporting the fact that free access to regulated abortions promotes health, well-being, and various other metrics of long-term positive outcomes for both individuals and society, whereas banning abortions is causally related to various metrics of suffering and illness.

I'm curious about the Buddhist philosophical perspective on these dilemmas I'm having, or if someone can point me to some resources on how to reconcile this dilemma.

For example: imagine you drive and a friend doesn’t. Your friend asks you to pick them up from the airport, but their flight gets in at 4am and you have a meeting at 9am so if you do this you won’t get adequate sleep and will struggle at work.

But if you don’t give your friend a lift, they will have to get a train home and their journey will take much longer and be more expensive and they will be poorly rested for their job that day.

Under such a situation, where the compassionate thing for your friend (give them a lift) is directly opposed to the compassionate thing for yourself (get adequate sleep), what should you do?

This makes philosophical sense to me but I struggle to see how it works in day-to-day life. I think I get it in the minute by minute, i.e. enjoy the thing you've been looking forward to when it arrives rather than thinking about the next thing as soon as you've got the former. But how does it apply to longer term stuff?

For example, I would say I'm probably more focused on the future than I should be. I feel like I frequently sacrifice near-term enjoyment, e.g. choosing to not watch TV and working instead, for the sake of future enjoyment, e.g. having enough time to do what I want because I worked hard earlier in life. While I believe this puts me in a good place for later life, I worry that I'm not living in the moment enough, and when I do focus on the 'now' then I find myself worrying about not doing enough towards my future.

I am struggling. I find myself no longer able to do what I must, or what society tells me I should be doing. I have lost all motivation to work, exercise, meet friends and family. I have lost the desire to strive and excel, to do and achieve. I find living to be an exhausting task. I can no longer see the purpose of these pursuits. I do not wish to accumulate any more wealth or experiences at this point. I am not sure why I have ended up this way. I no longer want what society/everyone else perceives as valuable - success, money, fame. Even enjoyment and pleasure. I am tired of the endless cycle of chasing and craving.

All I want to do is close my eyes and be given the time, space and quiet to rest deeply. I am unable to rest because I live in a noisy home and neighbourhood, and the weather in my country is extremely hot and humid. I can't sleep in peace.

I am scared that I have lost my ability to do the ""right"" things - keep a job and a stable income, exercise and stay healthy, maintain strong relationships. These things are meant to be important and necessary for human flourishing but why does it feel like so much effort to do them? Why does it not come more naturally to me? I used to force myself to do these ""right"" things but I think I no longer have the willpower to push through the dread. 

I would like to ask - is it alright if I allow myself to just do what I truly want? Can I eat what I want until I feel satisfied in my heart, body and spirit? Can I move only when I feel like moving and not force myself to keep to some kind of structured exercise routine? Can I only do work that I find meaning in? Is this not the natural way to live? Can I live more intuitively and spontaneously without having to fear the future or worry about consequences? 

But I am afraid that just doing what I truly want and what feels right in the moment will ruin me. That if I ate and move as my body wants, it will lead to health issues. That if I worked at jobs that do not drain my soul, it will cause financial instability. Everyone tells me so. I'm not sure if there's still a place here in this world.

I’m a member of Alcoholics Anonymous, I’ve been clean and sober for just over three years. 

I’ve always struggled with the idea of “God’s will” and just the whole God thing in general, it doesn’t sit with me. Long story short. I’m 38 years old and all my life I’ve been surrounded by Christians and I’ve made myself feel guilty for not believing what I’m “supposed” to believe. And it’s crept up again in AA. 

I should mention, AA does say “God as you understand him” and constantly encourages us throughout the literature to chose a God of our own understanding. A Higher Power. Which I can get behind. But there are still a lot of members who believe in this actual sort of “being” or entity that has a “will” for ME personally which I just don’t buy…

WELL - I met a Zen Buddhist chaplain in the program, we had coffee together yesterday and it was so good. I think not only to hear someone tell me I can be sober without “God” but that I can be spiritual without “God”. I always knew this but I needed some confirmation that I’m not “doing it wrong” and the principles described in Buddhism align with my values and my beliefs and I want to understand more about this 

Anyway I had a thought today I wonder if anyone could answer a question - The program teaches us that the fact that we got sober was “God’s will” for us, like there’s this master plan (or whatever) and I now owe my gratitude to this higher power, who reached out his/her/its hand and allowed me to have the gift of sobriety. 

My question is -

What would a Buddhist say about this? Why was I able to recover when so many are not? Why me? 

A.A. says it’s the “will” of my higher power. What do you say to that?

I’m new to this subreddit. I joined because I’m naturally very drawn to some of the concepts of life/ death that I’ve recently read about in No Death, No Fear, a book that I saw recommended in a post someone else made about fearing death. 

The past 12 months has been one of the toughest seasons of my life. I had never had anyone close to me pass away and then I watched my father pass from colon cancer right before my eyes. It was heartbreaking and precious at the same time. Just a few days later, I started to experience medical issues myself that ultimately led to me discovering I had precancer in a couple different areas, not related to his cancer. This was the first time in my life that I had experienced any health scare. I was diagnosed with illness anxiety disorder and even some residual PTSD from my issues. Although my precancer was successfully removed, I’m now again facing the possibility of precancer elsewhere, which will be tested for this month.  

I have come to realize that I’ll never be able to live my life again until I truly accept illness and death as a possibility, even at my young age of 30s. I also realized I must accept the cards I was dealt with my health issues I’m experiencing. 

* Does anyone have any words of comfort or reassurance? 

* Does anyone have any other books that would bring me peace? 

I have a really hard time accepting that we must die. I come from southern US where mostly everyone is a Christian. I’ve always tried so hard to believe in Christianity but I never could, even as a child. I never thought much more about it in my teens and 20s. I want so badly for there to be something more after this life, for my sake as well as my children and family. I’ve prayed, I’ve talked to God, I’ve called out but I never truly feel it to be true in my heart. My family has always told me “You better start believing” but belief cannot be forced. What they don’t see is I WANT to have faith, belief, etc because I feel that will help me overcome my fears and also, who wouldn’t want a magical place to go to after death? 

I can’t help but cry as I type those words above. This fear and desperation takes over my days. I have tried therapy but I need something more than grounding techniques. I need true faith and belief in SOMETHING. I wish I could experience something to get me there. I’ve even fantasized for a near death experience, one that you read about how it has changed peoples lives for the better where they have zero fear of dying and actually welcome it. 

I’m sorry if this is not the forum for this type of post or discussion.

This is a short passage excerpted from the *Compendium of the Dharma* (*Dharmaskandha*) preserved in Chinese and is attributed to the arhat Mahāmaudgalyāyana. The original Chinese is below.

《阿毘達磨法蘊足論》卷9：「謂有一類，作是思惟：「我於佛教所說勝定且未脩習，先應誦持經律對法，為諸有情宣說法要，學諸傳記製造疏論，居阿練若但持三衣，廣說乃至隨得而坐，作此事已然後習定。」復有一類，作是思惟：「我於佛教所說勝定且未脩習，先應歷觀山川國土園林池沼巖窟塚間，禮旋制多、遊觀諸寺，為此事已然後習定。」復有一類，作是思惟：「我於佛教所說勝定且未脩習，待過七年六年五年四年三年二年一年、或過七月乃至一月、或過七日乃至一日、或過此晝或過此夜、過此時已，然後習定。」如是思惟，於自身命不了危脆，起心尋求遍尋求乃至思惟分別」(CBETA 2022.Q4, T26, no. 1537, pp. 497c27-498a11)",False,On Impermanence,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/1bwfteb/on_impermanence/

A lot of the concepts, and ideas I agree with, however the doctrine of non-self is something my mind is just not ready for right now. I find it depressing, it feels as if it completely destroys my world view and I don't know which way is up anymore. I feel completely confused about it, as if I'm going to blink into non-existence at any moment.

I feel like someone who has gotten in way over their head, like a young child who has never seen a horror movie, but accidentally stumbles upon their father's copy of the Texas chainsaw massacre lol.

I don't know of anyone in my life who I can explain this to with out sounding like a crazy person. So I believe the best thing for me to do is to forget about the non-self doctrine for now, and continue to develop in other ways until I reach a point where I am better able to accept it.

3120,Buddhism,squizzlebizzle,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7da6fa283d30>,1712301988.0,True,t3_1bwc02m,4,/r/Buddhism/comments/1bwc02m/considerations_on_abuse_in_buddhism_and_society/,17,"It is a major meta-pattern of society that people are traumatised and in carrying this trauma they repress certain parts of themselves and certain emotions. Emotional repression is a core problem in the world and in people’s lives. Sometimes they repress emotions because they are painful to experience, and sometimes because they’re compelled to or forced to because of an abusive relationship or circumstance.

When one is being abused, one is expected to suppress certain aspects of oneself to keep the abuser’s public charade of being good. If you express anger, it will challenge their domination over you. And if others see your anger it will attract attention and they can be caught. So you will be forced to suppress and hide the negative emotions that the abuser is causing you.

When narcissistic energies are at play in the world, abusive relationship patterns emerge in which abusers psychologically predate upon abused. In such a relationship, someone in the “prey” role might feel totally convinced that expressing anger is shameful and wrong because you’ve been convinced by them as such. Because if you were angry, you might stand up to them and establish personal boundaries. You might expose them. They might face justice.

In this age of the Kali Yuga, authentic religious practice is subverted. False prophets attract great crowds. Interest in the mere appearance of Dharma eclipses the recognition of the substance. Many people are seduced by outer appearances and misled.

One manifestation of this is that so many abusive patterns can pervade the world unchecked. In many cultures narcissistic, psychopathic, or otherwise malignant sexual abusers can clothe their behaviors in false piousness like a camouflage.

If you molest a child in a culture where peacocking suppressive piousnessness is considered a virtue-signal, it's very easy to tell the child that they're dirty and corrupted and that because sex is so dirty and wrong, that if they tell anyone, they will be blamed. And thus they must never tell anyone and to just keep getting raped forever. It's very easy for the child to really believe it's their fault and that society will consider them guilty of a crime. Because usually that’s how it is in the world right now.

I had one friend who was raped by her uncle and when her parents found out they said they'd dare not tell anyone or it would bring shame to the family. She was forced to shut up about it - even though the uncle is still right there. Nothing happened to him. In some ways, her parents’ complicitness was even more vile and defiling than the rape.

This archetype of experience is not unique or specific to my friend. Many of the women I ever knew had been raped or molested, either as an adult or child, sometimes more than half. This is the dirty secret housed by oppressive attitudes about sex including in any religion. People need to check their houses. Outwardly, my friend's parents appeared very pious.

Performative piousness is a tool of abusers and these energies of demonic narcissism mix themselves in with ideas about religion because demons clothe/camoflage themselves with the moral righteousness of false piety.

Catholic priests taught the world that the outward appearance of piousness is worthless. Outwardly, if one is really convinced that sexual energies are morally shameful, then the requirement for perfect celibacy makes you seem superhuman. We all hunger for the flesh, so if someone is superior even to our human urges then he must be so divine. (Claims about) maintaining celibacy must prove that he is so high and morally pure. This moral purity is expressed in his these special clothes and his official title in an organisation with worldly power. All these are indicators of authentic spiritual attainment. These markers can be taken at face value without any scrutiny as being agents of God and therefore we should not look closely at what they're doing.

When the children show discomfort about being around their priest, or having to go to church, or be left alone with them, they punished the kids. This priest is celibate - he must be Holy, anything he does to my kid is good. If my kid is scared of him for some reason - it must be because my kid is lying or bad. Maybe if I say something, the priest will accuse me of lying and no one will believe me.

The priest will convince my parents. I am lying, scheming! I am jealous and naughty and plotting against the pure celibate priest who is a good man. Maybe I am lying? Maybe I am crazy. No one believes what he did to me. My parents punish me harshly if I bring it up.  They punished me even for being afraid.

Sex is so shameful in their religion and culture - how impossibly embarassing it would be if anyone heard their accusations. It must not be true. So if that’s you, and it happens to you, and you try to tell your parents they’ll just make you shut up about it. Because it’s embarrassing. They’d rather not deal with the embarrassment of having a child with yucky sex problems. Also, they’d lose face. Depending on what culture you are from, they value their face more than your life. Especially if you are a girl. Sometimes girls are not considered human. In this way shyness about sex among parents served as an additional cloak for sexual abuse by family members, anyone with power, or religious figures. Parents, perhaps unwittingly, facilitated in serving their own children’s flesh to the wolves.

This is true of other cultures and other religions, not only catholic priests. There are Buddhist organisations that need to clean their house. And Buddhist families that need to clean house. There are uncles and aunts that shouldn't be left alone with children and the family doesn't talk about it because they're good buddhists and good buddhists don't talk about sex, it's improper and it's bad karma.

This topic has stirred me for a long time. Not only from my own experiences of abuse, or of those of my close friends and family. But also because I am a career teacher and I see every pattern of intimate abuse playing out in the world around around me.

I’ve written about this in earlier posts on this subreddit, wrestling with the enormity of expressing this voice about how suppressive religious attitudes about sexuality and the body are harmful and are a cloak for abuse. This cloak is the reason that the Buddhist daughter who is being raped by her uncle can't tell mommy and daddy about it because they're Buddhist and (they think that) means that non-celibacy is inherently a moral aberration and thus is inherently shameful and should not be discussed - not even in a didactic way. Even healing and age-appropriate discussion of sexual knowledge can be suppressed in a way that, intentionally or inadvertently, irradiates the child’s relationship with their own body and psyche with shame. Cultural beliefs about shamefulness of the body are passed from parent to child priming an environment where an an experienced abuser can pick up on patterns of toxic shame as a weapon against the kid. A kid who is too ashamed to fight back is the perfect victim.

In Afghanistan, they're stoning women again. I wrote a few article before in which I talked about abuse against women including sexual abuse. I consider this to be a sort of unified meta-issue. Every time I've tried to talk about the harms of excessive piousness about sexuality and the body and how these are a cultural force which serves to oppress women (and children, and boys and men)… I tend to encounter fury and pitchforks. And censorship. The fourth wall breaks, and the voices I described in my post emerge in the comments. You shouldn’t talk about this. It’s dirty - and shameful. They defend the abuse. It is a poetic meta-expression of this archetype and mandala. The voice decrying suppressiveness is itself suppressed. It is a painting of a painting of samsara.

The probate that one not feel, or discuss the healthy expression of some emotion, is always abusive and always connected to patterns of abuse. This is where piousness bridges into abuse. Someone who is being abused can't ever really talk about it unless they’re allowed culturally talk about sex, sexual desire, the body and sexual energies. You can’t talk about what is healthy, if you can’t talk at all.

The idea that emotional suppressiveness is spiritual practice is a snake of Mara. It is the sword of demons. Authentic spiritual practice entails openness to the full presence of our experience. Suppressiveness is always abusive, either to oneself or to another. Healthy practice frees you from emotional self-suppression. Or the sickly energies which confusedly feel compelled to suppress other parts of your own self become healed and then thus this self-suppression, which had been like an autoimmune reaction, resolves.

But everywhere in this world it is unresolved and it festers. People are seething with rage at the oppression they’ve endured, the indignance, the humiliation. They can never be free so long as they must hide it. But hide it they must. They must smile - and engage in the virtue signals of their culture to survive.

The belief that suppressing oneself is “morality” sets the stage for all manner of patterns of abuse to go unnoticed. A person with deep suppressed anger is likely to have been abused and controlled and these people are everywhere in our world. It is utter misery. It is slavery. The believe that you must suppress and hide your emotions and experiences because they are wrong is the original chain that keeps us all in bondage.

In bondage, we are held to the code of abuse. To uphold the Big Lie - that the abuse is not happening. To deny reality. We must act like can’t see it we can never call it what it is. We are enraged by the humiliation and indignity of receiving abuse. But there is no room to express this emotion and we must hide it. We must put on the face that everything is okay. Forcing a smile that rends our hearts with the power of its lie for the sake of survival. But what kind of life is a life on your knees? Anyone who has experienced abuse or seen it in a loved one must feel utterly compelled to do something about it.

The belief that your emotions are wrong and invalid and you have to deny them in order to be worthy as a person or gain moral approval is essentially demonic. In this way demons and angels are so close. Sometimes they are indistinguishable. True power is at a knife’s edge. Just a whif of ego and even divine power can be come like poison. Like Devadata.

Patterns of suppresion symptomatic of abuse span our world. Including an abusive economic society where the power-classes abuse the working-classes. Abusive families where mothers and children are beaten and children are regularly raped. Abusive religious practices where you're compelled to present outward piousness or face ostracism or violence. Abusive political systems where you must obey or be imprisoned or killed. And thus you must suppress your authentic heart in order to survive. It can also relate to children growing up being abused by family members where they are forced to present certain emotions, even when those emotions were not authentic, thus causing a traumatic fracture in their psyche that causes severe pain their whole life. Their ocean of voices scream out for the truth to be heard lest this whole world burn down to expose it.

There is a particular story I once learned that I felt is perfectly expressive of a certain archetypal problem in our world. In India, a young girl had her period, but because they are so taboo about talking about the woman’s body or sexuality, she could not tell anyone and she hid it in shame. Full of dirty festering rags she’d stuffed into her self, she got an infection. She died.

Why couldn’t she tell her parents that she’d gotten her period? Consider this. What must they have said to her to make her so terrified of discussing her vagina that she died to keep her wounds a secret? What was she hearing her parents say to each other and to other people about women and the vagina?

I might venture to guess that in that girl’s culture - harsh pious attitudes about the woman’s body and about sexuality are taken as virtue signals. They were doing everything a proper parent of their religion should do to their daughter to learn about sex - they were making sure that she knows it’s dirty and wrong and she must never think about it. This belief led to her horrible death.

I read a book about the Dalai Lama’s advice to Buddhist practitioners and a lot of the advice relies on visualising something. 

For example, to cultivate feelings of compassion towards strangers we might first imagine ourselves suffering a fate that the stranger is suffering, then we might imagine a loved one suffering in the same way, and then finally we extend the compassion that we have for ourself and our loved one to the stranger.

A lot of the Dalai Lama’s practices involve something like this. It seems we are supposed to literally see with our mind’s eye the situation being considered.

I have two difficulties here:-

Firstly, I struggle with hypothetical situations. For most people, if you describe some hypothetical situation (for example that they are on a rollercoaster ride) they respond as if they are actually feeling how it would be in that situation - they actually get excited or nervous.

Whereas I don’t. I can tell you that I think I would probably be very scared of the rollercoaster and that I would not like it, but I can’t *feel* the hypothetical situation unless I am actually in that situation or I am remembering a time when I was in that situation.

Secondly, I have no mind’s eye. I can “imagine” a thing in the sense that I can describe things about it (I know that apples are usually red or green) but if asked to imagine an apple, I don’t *see* anything.

So if I try to follow the Dalai Lama’s approach - for example, by cultivating compassion for homeless people by imagining how I would feel if I were homeless, the most I really get there is “I would probably be frightened, vulnerable, and hungry”. But I don’t feel it or see it at all.

Is there a way to get around my difficulties here and to make the Dalai Lama’s approach work for me?

[https://neuroticgradientdescent.blogspot.com/2020/01/mistranslating-buddha.html](https://neuroticgradientdescent.blogspot.com/2020/01/mistranslating-buddha.html)

>Tanha is usually translated as desire or craving but this is wrong and misleading. Tanha is more literally translated as 'fused to' or 'welded to'. It immediately follows the mental moment that you zoom in with the attentional aperture on something. It could be that a flower or an item on the shelf at the supermarket captures your attention, or you turn your head to catch more detail as you pass by an accident on the road. Many hundreds of thousands of such events take place in the course of a single day. With most of them attention then relaxes and makes space for the next thing. But with some small proportion you find the mind doesn't quite 'unclench' from the object or some aspect of the object. This tension aspect is why it is sometimes translated as ‘grasping’ which is closer. Imagine something you aren’t finished with being pulled out of your hand and you tensing your fingers to resist.

Even if they're wrong about tanha, I think this is a brilliant insight. So much of my suffering comes from my unconscious/subconscious wandering of attention.

**Chotso of Banma County (Householder, 1973-2012)**

**Summary**

Chotso was a nomad who had a deep love for livestock animals since childhood. She accumulated immense virtues while working in the pastures. Before her passing, she said, “The entire house is filled with the fragrance of incense. I am not in a confused state. All of us should feel happy! Amitabha Buddha has come to take me.” She passed away right after.

**Life Experiences:**

(1) Recitation of over 20 million times of Amitabha Buddha's name

Born in the Tibetan 16th Rabjung Water Ox Year (1973), Chotso came from Jang-ri-tang town in Banma County, Golok Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province. Despite her unfulfilled wish to become a nun due to her mother's refusal, she diligently recited more than 20 million times of Amitabha Buddha's name while working in the pastures. She also completed the 500,000 Ngondro more than three times.

(2) Compassion for Livestock

Known for her deep affection for animals, Chotso would shed tears upon witnessing others mistreat animals by throwing stones. When her family slaughtered or sold livestock for butchering, she would remain silent and stony-faced for several days. Every evening, regardless of the season, she would kiss each livestock before returning home. Even if it was late and others urged her to come home, she would not leave until she had kissed every animal. She would also address the little calves endearingly, saying, “darling,” and caressed their heads. When an animal died, she would vow to recite 10 thousand Mani mantras for them.

If a male calf or bull died, she would express her relief, saying, “This is very good, otherwise you will be slaughtered by my brother when you grow up.” She felt that the male animals that died were very lucky to not have to go under the knife. One winter, when Karma Gyal intended to slaughter a bull he had bought for 3,000 yuan, Chotso pleaded with him in tears, “Brother, I will recite a million times of Amitabha's name for you and give my earrings to you to sell for some money, please do not kill this bull.” Eventually, her brother couldn’t help but relent. He released the bull. Even the way she named the animals was unique, she gave them auspicious names such as “Merits”, “Fortune”, “Deva” etc. Everyone saw in her an exemplary kindness for animals.

**Final Moments**

About the age of 36, Chotso contracted tuberculosis and later passed away at the age of 40. On the morning of her death, she told her brother Karma Gyal that she no longer needed the money and medicine he provided, returning them to him.

She also said, “I have been ill for four or five years already. I have been to the hospital, taken medicine and nothing works. If I die, this is also a natural cycle of life and death that everyone goes through in samsara. You all should not grieve in your hearts. I vow to you that I have not the slightest fear in me. I believe that I have the provisions and merits for future lives. After I die, you need not arrange any merits for me. Our old mother is a sick patient, perform some pujas for her instead.” After saying these touching words, her mother wept and so Chotso stopped speaking.

In the afternoon at around 4pm, she suddenly instructed Sangtso, “Go and milk the cows right away, if you delay, I am not sure if you will still have the chance to milk the cows. No matter what, go right now!” Sangtso went to milk the cows immediately.

Later, while drinking tea with her mother and Sogyal, Chotso told Sogyal, “Burn some pine cypress incense in the house. I do not think I am confused. In my entire life till now, although I have not created any great virtues, I have also not committed any serious non-virtue. If I am not confused, then this news will make us all happy. Protector Amitabha has come for me now.” Sogyal replied, “That’s wonderful! If Amitabha comes for you, you should be happy. This is something that also fills us with joy.” Saying this, Sogyal rose and lifted the fabric covering the thangka and said that he had already lighted the pine cypress incense. Right then, Chotso gave two long exhalations and passed on without the slightest suffering or pain.

(On August 28, 2020, we, the editors, visited Jang-ri-tang town in Banma County, Golok Prefecture, Qinghai Province. We conducted interviews with the deceased's brother, Karma Gyal, his younger brother, Sogyal, daughter-in-law Sangtso, relatives Laykyi, and Sang Agong, among others. At that time, their statements were corroborated by their Gurus, Osel and Kater, who were also their relatives. After compiling the written account based on their accounts, we presented it to them for review, and they confirmed the accuracy of the information. We did not just rely on this; rigorous verification was conducted from various sources before recording this here.)

The review is about the small Buddhist group centered in Santa Cruz/San Jose, California, called the Nagavara Raja Buddha Lineage, also called Manjushri Lineage.  Note that there are several other lineages by a similar name. 

The review is pretty sparse, to give a few insights to anyone who chances on the review who is considering becoming a serious student of this group.  

Whenever you join a new group, before getting deeply involved and committed, try to learn everything there is to learn about the leader. If there is a lot of privacy and mystery about the leader's background and living situation, it may be a flag for you.  And pay attention to how the newer and older practitioners are treated.  Are they usually treated with kindness and compassion? Is the feeling generally warm and relaxed between the teacher and the practitioners?  

In retrospect, I missed a lot of flags for a lot of years, and excused many others that I did notice but figured they were beyond my understanding, I'm just not wise enough yet to see it. I left after multiple years with the group.  Several of us were made to feel bad for peacefully leaving. 

To possibly help the next people who try to research this small community, I am writing this review.  By sharing my experiences, maybe even one other person can have more information to make their decisions.  

The Buddha and Bodhisattvas want us all to treat each other with basic kindness and compassion. That is what drew me and still draws me to the teachings of Buddha.

I have difficulty accepting this idea because it proposes a nihilism view that infers that since none of us are real, it doesn’t matter if someone dies. Following this philosophy, one would become cruel and heartless– I wouldn’t care if my parents or friends die; I wouldn’t care about their feelings because they are not real. That doesn’t seem like the goal of Buddhism. So what am I missing?

Buddhism also suggests that everything is made by our mind, and they only exist when we think about them. If this is true, then it means other people are fake– they don’t exist when I don’t think about them. But in reality they do exist. For example, my friend calls me out of nowhere from another city. In this case, I’m not thinking about my friend, yet he calls me which means he exists even when I’m not thinking about him. He calls me from another city which means the city exists even when I’m not thinking about it. This contradicts the Buddhist theory that everything is mind-made.

In particular, I read often how the most enlightened practitioners of Buddhism confine themselves to monasteries so as to more fully focus on their dhamma, chanting or praying for the liberation of all beings.

I understand there are many esoteric nuances to this -- that spiritual progress often times operates on internal layers that radiate out from a loving heart into the external world, for example. But I am still caught up on the idea that by removing yourself from society and relying on donations to support a monastic lifestyle, you're removing yourself from the hard work the rest of the world is left to keep communities & families alive and well.

Of course, having a place of refuge for spiritual seekers, as well as the thought leadership that comes from monks advocating for philosophies of peace, do contribute positively to the world. But is there no hope for salvation from samsara in this lifetime for the one who sees their calling to be good to the people around them, to be diligent with their responsibilities as they are laid before them, to more fully engage with the loved ones who are interconnected with their life? How can one fully uncover their buddha-nature without devoting oneself to a life of isolation from temptation, sutra study, and advanced prayer? And is the ideal world where everyone is saved a world where everyone is withdrawn and in monastic community like this?

Constantly in the midst of great assemblies, I shall expound the Dharma the way a lion roars. I shall make offerings to all Buddhas, Fully acquiring the roots of virtue. My vows and wisdom shall be completely accomplished. I shall be a hero of the Three Domains. My unhindered wisdom shall be like that of Buddhas, Thoroughly illuminating everywhere. May the power of my merit and virtue Be equal to those of the Most-Honored Ones.

He was Tibetan, so I'm interested to know what would typically be done, but since I really am not great at performing long ceremonies I'd like to hear from many different schools of thought.

Also, might be a bit wrong since it’s from knowledge so bare with me pls. 

Firstly, I have questions about desire. Is all desire negative? I have studied and have been pretty much taught that all craving is rooted in Dukkha. I agree! It makes sense because if you desire to be happy (like most of us do) then you will suffer when you are not happy whether it’s not much or a lot. But what about desire for good things? If someone desires to be enlightened, does that hinder a Buddhist from 
being enlightened due to desire? 

Also, why do you choose one type of Buddhism from another? I know this is a personal question but I’m curious. I went to a Buddhist centre and he (the Buddhist centre teacher) said that all different beliefs in Buddhism are held equal. If this is the case, why be Theravada or Zen or Pure Land or whatever one you decide?

March 2024 marked the start of an exciting journey for me as I headed to Kathmandu, Nepal. The thrill of finally meeting my long-distance friend and colleague face-to-face, along with the allure of exploring Nepal's rich culture, filled me with anticipation.

Upon arriving in Kathmandu, I settled into a cozy hotel, eagerly awaiting my friend's arrival. The vibrant energy of the city, with its bustling markets and ancient temples, served as a backdrop to our productive work sessions. Amidst brainstorming and planning, I found moments of tranquility by immersing myself in the beauty of Kathmandu and Lalitpur.

As an avid collector of antique artifacts, especially those reflecting Buddhist artistry, I seized the opportunity to delve into Kathmandu's cultural offerings. Each statue I encountered during my exploration seemed to hold a unique story, showcasing Nepal's deep spiritual heritage.

The highlight of my trip was stumbling upon a magnificent Buddha statue that exuded a sense of tranquility and wisdom. It felt like the statue itself embodied the [profound teachings of Buddhism](https://www.originalbuddhas.com/blog/the-influence-of-buddhism-on-culture-and-society) – a reminder of the importance of mindfulness and inner peace in today's hectic world.

This makes me confused but also sad because I have been struggling with this since I was a kid. I am no saint but it's mind boggling to me that just this alone will bring me to hell.

I know most here will say it's fine because I am not a monk & don't have to practice celibacy. 

I have people around me that have achieved a certain level of divination for them to know practically anything. It seems like they get upset whenever I do so, plus bad things do happen. I also get insane bad luck on the same say itself. 

What's the truth then, it's tiring living in guilt. I actually find life easier & masturbation forgettable when I remove the shame in it. Do it & move on type of thing. The external pressure from people I know is soul crushing, and I get stuck in this vicious cycle.

I know I don't need a scripture to tell me that it does have bad consequences, especially if you view p0rn. But I feel like I should hear from people that are actually knowledgeable on this. I also actively trying to remove this habit but I am stuck for years.

This has been bothering me for months but when I try to talk to my mom about it she puts her hands together while bowing and says “I can no longer talk about this or else I will be born in the hells” because she believes that her master can read her thoughts and she isn’t allowed to discuss any negative thoughts or doubts about the master (who claims to be a living buddha). I don’t feel like this is what buddhism is about, although I am not buddhist I have read many of the books she gave me and from what I understand this doesn’t sound like what Shakyamuni Buddha preached. My mom spends all day and night praying to the master and asking for forgiveness, she has pictures of him everywhere and sends me his pictures before I take an exam because she believes it will give me good luck. She says that I can ask this man anything if I want, however it has to be translated because he doesn’t know english. I just assumed someone who claims to be a buddha who can read minds can at least read mine and understand it. I think this is all just a scam and I want to help my mother but I don’t know what to do. When I try to ask about the miracles this man claims he can do she says that it’s a “secret” and that I have to take refuge to the master in order to know.

I tried saving her, but could not. I (and my younger sibling) was raised by a single parent(father) and his old sick mother(my grand mother). My dad had a lot of anger management issues, and I was humiliated / beaten /shouted at if things did not go his way (so was my brother). Once I finished high  school, I moved out of town to attend college(partly because I wanted to  create a distance) and later to another country entirely(for my higher education), and did not look back to  move back with my father/the country I was raised in.

I did see a therapist /CSAT(individually) who was trauma informed + EMDR, and my spouse and I also went to  marriage therapy(together). While I understand that I have some childhood trauma, therapy did not qualitatively change my (childhood) narrative and we only found marginal benefits with marriage therapy. I am looking at taking magic mushrooms(with a guide) to see if it can help me with resolving my childhood trauma, and to understand myself better

My dad now is in the last stages of his life, is sick, and slowly dying. I am also learning that childhood trauma has had an impact on my life, and my marriage. While I am thankful that my dad provided for me (and my brother) I still carry a lot of resentment towards him. And grudge/anger towards my mother for killing herself. I am not really sure what to do (not really looking at therapy, it did not work. Or, do you have a specific therapy modality? suggestion?).

**Ngagi from Dartsedo county (householder, 1932-2012)**

**Summary**

Ngagi was a woman who had a very gentle disposition. On her deathbed, she said, ""In the past, I only knew that Amitabha’s body was red, I did not know that he had a crown protuberance (ushnisha). But today, I clearly know what Amitabha looks like. Now, Amitabha Buddha has come to fetch me and I am going to Sukhavati."" After that, she hurriedly turned to her right side and passed away immediately.

**Life Experience**

Born on the Tibetan 16th Rabjung Water Monkey Year (1932), Ngagi hailed from Lale Village in Tagong Township, Dartsedo County, Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province. Her father was Tsewang Gongpo, and mother was Yazong. HH Jigme Phuntsok Rinpoche held three Sukhavati grand pujas, and Ngagi participated in the first two pujas. She also vowed to recite four million repetitions of the sacred name of Amitabha Buddha and completed her vow.

**Final Moments**

Before she passed on, she said to her son Jigme Rigzin and others, ""When I visualize the protector Amitabha in my mind, he appears as a red deity. Apart from this, I can’t visualize anything else. But now, when protector Amitabha appears to my eyes, he is not only red in color, but has a flesh protuberance on his crown. So this is how he appears. Now I know what Amitabha really looks like. Amitabha and HH Jigme Phuntsok have arrived to fetch me, I am going to Sukhavati. What are you doing running here and there with the flowers? Help turn my body to the right side."" After she hurriedly gave these instructions, Jigme Rigzin and Khenpo Chopal quickly turned Ngagi's body to the right side. She stopped breathing instantly and passed away.

(On 26th July 2020, we (the editors) arrived at Lale village and interviewed Jigme Rigzin, Khenpo Kunpal and others. Their statements were collated in a document and reviewed by themselves. We not only relied on the deceased’s dying words but also collected testimonies from various interviewees who knew of this matter. With strict corroboration from various angles and sources, we concluded that this account was reliable and recorded it here.)

**Record 3**

**Dotse from Zadoi County (Householder, 1938-2019)**

**Summary**

Dotse lived an honest and simple life. While making a living, he engaged consistently in practice sessions and recitation. Prior to his passing, he felt that he truly entered the pureland of Sukhavati, even witnessing the Protector Amitabha present there. Moreover, just before his departure, he said, ""You do not need to worry about my death. I am leaving now because I truly wish to be reborn in Sukhavati and it is for sure that I will be reborn there."" Subsequently, he passed away.

**Life Experience**

Born in the Tibetan 16th Rabjung Earth Tiger Year (1938), Dotse came from the Trage village, Sahu Teng Town of Zadoi County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province. He was a monk at Jizong Monastery when he was young. He also did a retreat at the meditation center. However, during the Cultural Revolution, he was forced to return to lay life, raising ten children amidst considerable hardships. Despite the challenges, he led a modest and peaceful life. He practiced in sessions in the early morning and late night, reciting texts and mantras. Also, he often placed a small Amitabha Buddha thangka (picture framed with tapestry in Tibetan style) at the head of his bed and completed a million recitations of Amitabha Buddha's name.

**Last Moments**

After he was struck down by a severe illness, in the morning of the seventh day before his death, he told his family, ""Last night, I had a rare dream. I found myself in a place I had never been to before. It was a pleasing and delightful place, with lush green grass and blooming white flowers. The scenery was exquisite with a sweet fragrance that permeated everywhere. It was indescribable with words. I felt reluctant to even step on the ground as it might tarnish the beauty even a little. Such is the beauty of this place! In my dream, I was going towards this place. When I woke up this morning, the memory of that beautiful place remained, my heart is filled with immeasurable joy and happiness. Now, it seems that it is time for me to leave to go to another place.""

One night, while his daughter Palmo was looking after him, he said, ""There are many words appearing there, and those words are not written on paper; they are all white 'Om (ཨཱྃ)' syllables, they are appearing in a layered manner with one syllable overlaying the other."" These were his inner visions, and externally there were no such syllables around him.

On another night, he said, ""There is a long deer horn beside me with the heart mantra of Padmasambhava carved on it."" Palmo replied, ""No, there isn't."" However, he insisted, ""Yes, there is! There is! It’s only that you can't see it."" Then, he began reciting the verses for offering mandala: ""The ground anointed with perfume, adorned with flowers, Mount Meru, four continents, the sun, and the moon, Visualized as a Buddha land and offered to you, May all beings enjoy this pure land.""

Later, on the fifth morning after having dreamt of that delightful place, he told his family and relatives, ""Today, I want to share some pleasing words."" With a joyful expression, he said, ""Today, the Sukhavati thangka at the head of my bed has transformed into the actual pureland. I have been reborn there and personally saw the majestic form of the Protector Amitabha. It is by nature a thangka but the place is Sukhavati. After arriving there, I leaped into space, circumambulated three times clockwise and when I looked down from the sky, all the mountain valleys were as in the summer time—beautiful and pleasant, with many lakes and ponds, all around was clear water and ethereal mist. I saw many such mountain valleys, among which there was only one I recognized and have visited before: Dangka’s prayerhall.

“Compared to the thangka’s picture, the actual Sukhavati is tens of thousand times more radiant. I saw Protector Amitabha in the middle of the pure-realm. His body is ruby-red in color, with a ushnisha on his crown, thousand-spoke wheels on the soles of his feet, and a bowl filled with nectar in his hands. The thangka in our home now has a different radiance compared to before. So all of you should a look and do not be noisy, place dadars (ceremonial arrows) and mandala offerings before the thangka, and offer incense well. I will definitely die now, but I have no fear of death.""

Continuing, Dotse said, ""Bring me some grains."" While offering the grains, he recited auspicious aspirations and some verses for good fortune. Tying a knot on a white khata scarf, and holding it in his hands, he bowed three times and said, ""Now tie the khata to the dadar. Family, children, relatives, whoever it may be, do not forget to stay united and harmonious as before, diligently practicing virtue. Don't worry about my death. I truly wish to be reborn in Sukhavati now and it is for sure that I will be reborn there. After so saying, with great diligence, he recited the Sutra of the Names of Manjushri. Gradually, Dotse became more and more drowsy, his voice faded, but his lips and tongue still continued the motion of reciting. When others recited the Sutra of the Names of Manjushri by his ear, Dotse looked happy and seemed to recite along, and then he passed on.

(On January 20, 2021, we, the editors, personally visited Zadoi County in Yushu Prefecture, and interviewed the deceased's son Decho, nephew Tashi, Yonba and others. On January 23, 2021, we returned to Yushu Prefecture and conducted detailed interviews with the deceased's daughter Yejung, son-in-law Wola, daughters Gonggi and Palmo, Sangchu Tsewang, Karma Tsewang, Jamyang, and others. We compiled the information based on what they shared, then had them review it. They confirmed that the account was accurate. We did not rely solely on the statements made by the deceased before his death or the testimony of only some interviewees familiar with the matter. Instead, we conducted verification from various sources and, after being certain of it's veracity, included the account here.

I know that are ways to go around this issues and still live a fulfilling and enjoyable life, but I’m considering every option at the moment.
This being said, here are my main questions regarding this matter:

1- What do I have to do to become a monk? What are the usual footsteps towards that goal? Is there anything I need to stay vigilant about (red flags/warnings)?

2- I was looking for food and shelter in exchange of community service and anything I might add to the community (soft skills). With this in mind, is there any place (worldwide) that meets this conditions and accept someone that shows up at the front door and ask for help?

3- Out of curiosity, if known, what are the most remote places on Earth that practice Buddhism and possibly meet the previous conditions?

I thank you in advance for your time and any possible help you could provide! I hope you have an amazing day!

I wrote a lengthy piece about a Secular approach to Buddhist Rebirth. I, in all honesty, believed I had come to an understanding of Rebirth which is frequently troublesome for me. I then rather naively posted it to this subreddit for feedback - which was forthcoming. It was at that point it was shown to me that I had gotten the wrong end of the stick and somewhat embarrassed myself. 

Like clockwork, here came the usual disheartened depressed feeling of failure. I don’t know many people who relish being wrong, but for me, it's rather less so. Making such a categorically misguided mistake seems to drive an arrow straight through one's heart. However, over the years I have come to appreciate that such things don’t last and that I will move on. 

I spent time meditating on my screw-up and came to the happy realisation that rather than lament upon it, I can appreciate it in such a way that this wrong thought I had has been nudged away by the community. They have prevented this wrong view from taking firm root. Not only that, I have come to smile at something else. I have the rather curious peccadillo of trying to run before I can walk - I guess not understanding something niggles me and so I try to climb up the topic far too fast. So yesterday, I did it again! I launched myself into a complex and nuanced topic, and well, fell flat on my face so to speak. 

I have since deleted the post to prevent it from being taken as correct by anyone stumbling across it. I was initially hesitant to do this due to the valuable contributions made by other members of this subreddit, but for the sake of maintaining the value of the content here, I decided best it was removed.

Yesterday then, was a reminder to stop running and savour the journey. I, like many, are on the path. I don’t know what’s around the corner, nor do I yet understand the nature of the entire path. But I can appreciate the path and relish in the discoveries that may be unveiled to me.

I'd like to prefice by saying that I am still looking for a temple/centre which is why I'm looking for wisdom here and not locally from my sangha because I don't have one. I live in Cymru currently in the middle of nowhere but am hoping once I move that I will be able to move somewhere with a Buddhist community where I can ask questions like this in person c:

One thing I've been struggling with in my journey becoming Buddhist is the notion that things out of your control like disability and mental health issues is because of bad karma.

I am currently reading the Dhammapada and I enjoy it but the first verse keeps plaguing my mind: The story about a blind man, Thera Cakkhupala, who is blind in this life because he blinded someone in his past life for not wanting to be enslaved to him.

It also makes me wonder in cases such as abuse... In the case of the blind doctor: Was the woman blinded for her own bad karma? This sounds terrible and victim-blamey if that's the case!

However, I understand that centuries ago we didn't really have an understanding of genetics and other factors that go into disability so I can see why perhaps this made sense to people? Perhaps I shouldn't be looking at this through a modern lens. I can also see why people might want a reason as to why they've suffered at the hands of someone else for their own healing. Even if I believe that's a rather unhealthy way to heal & disagree with it I can still understand that perspective.

In my opinion sometimes people are just bad and do bad things and it's not something we've done to deserve it but rather we just unfortunately happened to be on the receiving end of their own bad actions. Does that make sense? We live with the consequences of their actions but they're the ones who will suffer most for their abusive actions.

I really do believe in karma and reincarnation but as a disabled person myself I reject the idea that my disability is some sort of 'punishment' for lack of a better word for a past life. I am disabled because of my genetics. It's something I just happened to inherit. I personally don't necessarily see it as a positive or a negative it's only the inaccessible & ableist world I live in that tries to make it a negative, suffering experience.

Sorry for rambling so much. As you can see I've had a lot of thoughts on this...

I suppose I just wonder what other people with more experience in Buddhism think of this? I promise I do not mean any disrespect, I am genuinely asking and appreciate any and all serious responses. Thank you for your time reading this and I hope you have a nice day ♥️

His logic is something like this: anger can be good (justifiable anger at an injustice) or bad (disproportionate anger due to an inconvenience) and so can impatience (it’s good to have an impatience to eliminate suffering and to reach peace of mind, and it’s bad to be impatient with strangers for their behaviour).

In a similar way, though, it feels like we might say that hatred can be both good and bad. Perhaps we should hate suffering and want to eliminate it, while not hating other beings.

In a similar way, excessive compassion might cause us to fall victim to a scammer with a sob story, or to even be manipulated by an AI which is not capable of suffering. Perhaps we might sometimes be better off with less compassion.

**Yangchen from Hongyuan county (householder, 1925-1997)**

Yangchen lived a life without committing serious non-virtue, and she devoted herself diligently to virtuous practices such as prostrations and recitations. In the final days before her passing, she experienced the sensations of walking in a garden filled with flowers and fruits, feeling satisfied after eating fruits. At the moment of her actual passing, she vividly saw Lord Amitabha Buddha and his entourage arriving. She said, ""If you make sincere aspirations, they will come true."" Subsequently, she peacefully passed away in the posture of a lion lying down.

**Life Experience**

She was born in the Tibetan 15th Rabjung Wood Ox year (1925) in the Hongyuan District Wache Mawa Serdi Rongta Town of Aba County in Sichuan Province (autonomous region of the Tibetans and Qiang Ethnic Group). Her father's name was Gye Trinley, and her mother's name was Orgyen Wangmo. She had four siblings, and she was the youngest daughter. From her childhood, she refrained from serious negative karma and was a person who joyfully practiced virtuous deeds. Throughout her life, she recited the Mani Mantra approximately two hundred million times, the mantra of Manjushri one hundred million times, the mantra of Amitabha Buddha one hundred million times, and the sacred name of Amitabha Buddha one million times. Though the exact number of prostrations she accumulated is unclear, she worn out about three prostration wooden boards in her life.

**Manifestations at the Time of Death**

(1) Eating fruits for several days

At the age of seventy-two, in the winter of the Tibetan fire ox year (1997), on the fifteenth day of the eleventh month, which was an auspicious day for Amitabha Buddha, she passed away in the evening. About three days before her passing, she repeatedly told her nephew, Gedra, and others that she felt she had been to a place with many white flowers or was on the way to such a place. Sometimes she felt she was in a place with many fruits or was heading there, saying to Gedra, ""When we reach a place with many fruits, pick some and bring them to Kurutso."" In her perception, the flowers and fruits became more and more abundant day by day, and in the place where flowers and fruits grew, there were rivers. She said, ""My shoes got wet when I crossed the river just now, so I'm putting them in the sun to dry them a little."" She only talked about these special experiences.

From those days onward, she refused to eat anything, no matter what food was offered to her. When her family said, ""It's time to eat,"" she replied, ""I am not eating; I have ate fruits, and I'm already full. Don't ask me to eat; I'm full, feed Kurutso."" She did not feel hungry at all despite not eating anything and genuinely believed she had already eaten, experiencing a sense of fullness.

In general, dreaming of obtaining fruits and eating them is considered a symbol of meritorious deeds in one's lifetime. Buddha Shakyamuni also mentioned in the ""Mahayana Sutra for Confessing and Eradicating Negativities and Attaining Buddhahood"" that dreaming of obtaining and eating fruits signifies attaining the fruition of qualities in the present life.

(2) Clearly seeing Amitabha Buddha

On the morning of her day of passing, she said, ""Kurutso, Lord Amitabha Buddha and his entourage have come to our house! Clean the house and offer incense! If you make sincere aspirations, they will come true."" While saying this, she sometimes appeared to fall asleep, and when she seemed to wake up, she said, ""Lord Amitabha Buddha and his entourage have come to our house! Offer incense! Can you clean the house a bit more thoroughly? Make the house very clean! Make sincere aspirations, Lord Amitabha Buddha and his entourage have come here already. It is very clear. Did you see them? Quickly look!"" Since she kept saying such things, her daughter Kurutso and others around her could only respond, ""Yes, we saw, we saw.""

She then said to Kurutso, ""Now, I am going to the Pure Land. Afterward, you do not need to perform any virtuous merits for me. If there is a need for a so-called 'virtue,' then I already have it. You have already repaid my kindness."" She also said, ""Kurutso, when I am dying, if there aren't many people present, would you be afraid? If not, there's no need to call many people."" So, in the evening, apart from her daughter Kurutso, niece Pematso and two or three other family members, no one else was called. Later, she said, ""Place my right hand under my head and my left hand on my body."" After arranging herself in the lion-lying posture, she peacefully passed away, as if she had fallen asleep.

(On November 5, 2020, we (the editors) specifically visited the Rongta Village. After gathering the people directly related to this passing story, such as the deceased's daughter Kurutso and niece Pematso, we conducted a detailed interview. According to their accounts, we recorded their statements in a document and asked them to review it. They confirmed that the situation was true as reported, and we corroborated that everyone's statements were consistent. We also rigorously cross-verified the information from multiple sources in a very strict manner before including this account here.)

''In all the worlds the heavenly and human beings and asuras all believe that the present Shakyamuni Buddha, after leaving the palace of the Shakyas, seated himself in the place of practice not far from the city of Gaya and there attained annuttara-samyak-sambodhi. But good men, it has been immeasurable, boundless hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, millions of nayutas of kalpas since I in fact attained Buddhahood.''


""Good men, if there are living beings who come to me, I employ my Buddha eye to observe their faith and to see if their other faculties are keen or dull, and then depending upon how receptive they are to salvation, I appear in different places and preach to them under different names, and describe the length of time during which my teachings will be effective. Sometimes when I make my appearance I say that I am about to enter nirvana, and also employ different expedient means to preach the subtle and wonderful Law, thus causing living beings to awaken joyful minds.

""Good men, the Thus Come One observes how among living beings there are those who delight in a little Law, meager in virtue and heavy with defilement. For such persons I describe how in my youth I left my household and attained anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. But in truth the time since I attained Buddhahood is extremely long, as I have told you. It is simply that I use this expedient means to teach and convert living beings and cause them to enter the Buddha way. That is why I speak in this manner.

""Good men, the scriptures expounded by the Thus Come One are all for the purpose of saving and emancipating living beings. Sometimes I speak of myself, sometimes of others: sometimes I present myself, sometimes others; sometimes I show my own actions, sometimes those of others. All that I preach is true and not false.

Why do I do this? The Thus Come One perceives the true aspect of the threefold world exactly as it is. There is no ebb or flow of birth and death, and there is no existing in this world and later entering extinction. It is neither substantial nor empty, neither consistent nor diverse. Nor is it what those who dwell in the threefold world perceive it to be. All such things the Thus Come One sees clearly and without error.

""Because living beings have different natures, different desires, different actions, and different ways of thinking and making distinctions, and because I want to enable them to put down good roots, I employ a variety of causes and conditions, similes, parables, and phrases and preach different doctrines. This, the Buddha's work, I have never for a moment neglected.

""Thus, since I attained Buddhahood, an extremely long period of time has passed. My life span is an immeasurable number of asamkhya kalpas, and during that time I have constantly abided here without ever entering extinction. Good men, originally I practiced the bodhisattva way, and the life span that I acquired then has yet to come to an end but will last twice the number of years that have already passed. Now, however, although in fact I do not actually enter extinction, I announce that I am going to adopt the course of extinction. This is an expedient means which the Thus Come One uses to teach and convert living beings.''


""Why do I do this? Because if the Buddha remains in the world for a long time, those persons with shallow virtue will fail to plant good roots but, living in poverty and lowliness, will become attached to the five desires and be caught in the net of deluded thoughts and imaginings. If they see that the Thus Come One is constantly in the world and never enters extinction, they will grow arrogant and selfish, or become discouraged and neglectful. They will fail to realize how difficult it is to encounter the Buddha and will not approach him with a respectful and reverent mind.

""Therefore as an expedient means the Thus Come One says: 'Monks, you should know that it is a rare thing to live at a time when one of the Buddhas appears in the world.' Why does he do this? Because persons of shallow virtue may pass immeasurable hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, millions of kalpas with some of them chancing to see a Buddha and others never seeing one at all. For this reason I say to them: 'Monks, the Thus Come One is hard to get to see.' When living beings hear these words, they are certain to realize how difficult it is to encounter the Buddha. In their minds they will harbor a longing and will thirst to gaze upon the Buddha, and then they will work to plant good roots. Therefore the Thus Come One, though in truth he does not enter extinction, speaks of passing into extinction.''

> From the centre of the Circle [or Mandala], enhaloed in radiance of rainbow light, the supreme Knowledge-Holding [Deity], the Lotus Lord of Dance, the Supreme Knowledge-Holder **Who Ripens Karmic Fruits**, radiant with all the five colours, embraced by the [Divine] Mother, the Red Däkini,? [he] holding a crescent knife and a skull [filled] with blood, dancing and making the mudra of fascination, [with his right hand held] aloft, will come to shine.

It seems inconsistent with Buddhism for a god to be responsible for ripening karmic fruits (good and bad fortune). 

The Kevaddha Sutta has an amusing story depicting the supreme god admit his own ignorance.

> The Great Brahma appeared. A monk went up to him and said: ""Friend, where do the four great elements - earth, water, fire, air - cease without remainder?"" to which the Great Brahmä replied:
“Monk, **I am Brahma, Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Un-conquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Ruler, Appointer and Orderer, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be.""**
“A second time the monk said: ""Friend, I did not ask if you are Brahma, Great Brahma...I asked you where the four great elements cease without remainder."" And a second time the Great Brahma replied as before.
 'And a third time the monk said: ""Friend, I did not ask you that, I asked where the four great elements - earth, water, fire, air - cease without remainder."" Then, Kevaddha, the Great Brahma took that monk by the arm, led him aside and said: ""Monk, these devas believe there is nothing Brahma does not see, there is nothing he does not know, there is nothing he is unaware of. That is why I did not speak in front of them. But, monk, I don't know where the four great four great elements - earth, water, fire, air - cease without remainder.""

Now, to be clear, this story is very much tongue in cheek. But it suggests that the supreme god (here called the Great Brahma) May ripen karmic fruits; after all, he ordains everything. On the other hand, perhaps the Great Brahman is lying about his power, over stating it. He’s not all seeing, perhaps he isn’t all-ordaining either.

As title says, I contemplate the ''void'' in forms that I sleep very much or am on my phone, with no thought, no desire, no future. I have a form and depression and it's difficult for me to find pleasure in hobbies I liked before. I'm not able to stick to habits and routine. I lack confidence, I have fears that block me from doing things. Each time I set myself a plan, I'm saying to me ''yeah this time I will give it my all, I will surpass myself"", each time I can't follow the rules I fixed to myself.
It affects now my bf who is doing is best to support me, tries to motivate me but I stay in a victim position. Today we had a serious talk, he doesn't want to ''help'' me anymore (trying to motivate or coach me) because he thinks I have to reach ''the bottom''. If I reach that I have 2 choices : find the force to be in the flow, in the movement so I can overcome my fears, or embrace the darkness and liquefying myself into it.
I thought I had reached the bottom years ago, because I was in a worst state of mind.
I want to add I tried 3 treatment with my psychiatrist that my body rejected.
What do you suggest to me from a Buddhist perspective? What can give me the drive to live, to surpass my fears and be confident? I'm clueless at this point. I would like to find tricks for not falling again and again.

I just wanted to share that yesterday I was thinking about the many stories we create in our minds. 

Stories about our problems, desires, and professional ambitions. About the ups and downs of our romantic relationships, about the places in the world we have yet to explore and want to visit, about the hobbies we have and those we want to develop, our bodies, and the possessions we have or desire to acquire. 

Our minds never stop creating so many stories. We create and live our stories from the moment we wake up until we lay our heads on the pillow and fall asleep, to live the stories we dream while sleeping. 

""What would we be without them?"" is something we must ask. And ""free"" is the only answer in my heart, apart it also being very logical. Free to live whatever is happening now, wherever your body has placed you, with whomever you're with and wherever you are. 

That old, yet so ignored idea that seems only cheesy: to live in the present. Living like this seems catastrophically tedious, but that's just because we are addicted to stories. They are our true drugs. There is always another one to be invented and lived, whether successfully or not. 

They say in the world that living well is this: collecting stories and moments, but I confess that I have never felt more or less fulfilled by the number of stories I have lived, and believe me, there have been many, from the most normal to the craziest. My most well-lived moments were also the seemingly most ""boring"": the immense and intense pleasure that lies in doing nothing and connecting to everything. 

I know it doesn't seem like life can be like that. How can we pay bills, take care of our bodies, have friends, and a family? The truth is that we don't need that much. We don't need to create the best company in the world in a certain sector, nor proudly say that we have visited all the continents. We don't need huge apartments, nor luxurious cars or a million clothes and possessions. It takes little to be truly happy, but as good capitalist consumers, we don't realize this, we turn a blind eye and even defend it. 

We can't stay still. We need the next story, even though deep down it's always the same as the previous one: it's always good or bad, always impermanent, and always based on a desire that never ceases. And yet, they are everything to us. 

Maybe if we are able to relieve the pressure and put less weight on the stories, we can be less chaotic, frenetic, stressed, and dissatisfied. And perhaps if we are able to notice how our days are repetitions of the same unhappy and incessant cycle of stories upon stories, we can be calmer, freer, and finally, happier. 

Right? I think it connects with many things we learn with Buddhism.",False,[Thought] The many stories we tell ourselves to be happy,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/1bu0sdw/thought_the_many_stories_we_tell_ourselves_to_be/

""Therefore anyone who seeks total Enlightenment should discard not only all conceptions of their own selfhood, of other selves, or of a universal self, but they should also discard all notions of the non-existence of such concepts.”

In Buddhism, there is no concept of self. Everyone knows this. But nobody talks about rejection of non-self. And frankly speaking, I felt relieved after learning of this.

It might be difficult for everyone to accept both of this ideas together. In a way, we are accepting ""Nothing"" but in reality we are being agnostic. Strictly agnostic.

Like many, I've been having a rough few years. I feel fortunate that my practice and the Dharma have kept me grounded enough to stick around - but I've lost a lot of friends over the last decade. Most were deaths of despair. My heart has been broken so frequently that the focus of my practice has almost exclusively turned to sitting with my grief and hurt and feeling it fully, then praying for my friends and family that got lost in samsara.

This is my altar in progress. 

I started and stopped writing this post as I was filling out the memorial shelf - I was absolutely overcome by how many funeral programs and obituaries I have to memorialize. My dharma books on the left will need a new shelf. By the time this is done both the middle shelves will be full of memorials. I realized I'll need another light to illuminate their memorials and while rigging up some LEDs, I lost it. I miss my friends. I wish I could have helped them more. 

I'm sorry that there isn't more of a point to this post other than personal catharsis - I desperately needed to express my grief and now is not an appropriate time to reach out to my normal people. 

I hope you're all well tonight.

I have been feeling down recently. I have noticed that women I like are friendly and polite towards me but there is no desire most of the time to go further than initial friendliness and politeness.  

I am a guy with good social skills, in shape etc. and I have come to the conclusion my issue is my face. Being below average in looks means they don't want to spend any more time with me. I see other guys get girlfriends like its a walk in the park and I am here lonely - they do not care about me and its because of my looks. 

What's the best way of dealing with this from a Buddhist perspective? I know looks are impermanent etc. but I can't still help feeling down. Its annoying as well when people ask me how how's your love life etc. and I have to say I have literally nothing. What hurst the most is they don't even want proper friendship most of the time. I am starting to see women as shallow and cruel - I know this is wrong thinking though. Please help me.

Therefore, he appears in the world to disseminate the teaching of the Way, wishing to save the multitudes by endowing them with real benefits. This is difficult to encounter and see for countless billions of kalpas, like the udumbara flower that blooms but rarely. “Your question today is of great benefit and will enlighten all celestial and human beings. “Ananda, you should know that Tathagatas are perfectly enlightened. Their wisdom is unfathomable. They guide beings of diverse aptitudes. Their insights are free of obstacles, and nothing can limit or frustrate them. Nourished by a single meal, a Tathagata can sustain his life for 100,000 billion kalpas to immeasurable kalpas or even much longer. His sense faculties are filled with joy and delight, free from damage or decay. His physical form never changes, nor does his radiant countenance. Why is this? Because Tathagatas’ samadhi and wisdom are supreme, penetrating and limitless. They are free and at ease amid all dharmas. Ananda, listen carefully. I will explain this to you.” Ananda replied: “Certainly. I am willing, happy and eager to hear.” The Buddha told Ananda: “In the distant past, countless and unfathomably limitless kalpas ago, Tathagata Dipankara appeared in the world. He taught and delivered innumerable beings, enabled them all to attain enlightenment, and manifested Parinirvana. He was followed in succession by Tathagatas Pratapavat (Far-Reaching Light), Moonlight, Candana Fragrance, Virtuous Mountain-King, Heavenly Crown of Sumeru, Sumeru-Like Luminous, Moon Color, Correct Mindfulness, Impurity Free, Non-Attachment, Dragon Deva, Night Light, Sumeru Summit, Immovable Ground, Wondrous Vaidurya Flower, Vaidurya Golden Hue, Gold Treasury, Glowing Light, Glowing Root, Earth Seed, Moon Image, Sun Voice, Liberation Flower, Splendid Radiance, Supernatural Power from Oceanic Enlightenment, Water Light, Great Fragrance, Free of Dust and Dirt, Removing Mental Weariness, Treasure Glow, Wondrous Peak, Valorous Stand, Virtue-Support Wisdom, Outshining the Sun and Moon, Vaidurya Sun and Moon Lights, Unsurpassed Vaidurya Light, Supreme Leader, Bodhi Flower, Moon Brightness, Sunlight, King of Flower Hue, Water Moonlight, Dispelling the Darkness of Ignorance, Practice of Removing Hindrance, Pure Faith, Abiding in Goodness, Magnificent Divinity, Dharma Wisdom, Phoenix Voice, Lion Voice, Dragon Voice, and Tathagata Staying in the World.

His name was ‘Lord of Freedom in the World (Lokesvararaja)’, a Tathagata (Thus-Come One), Arhat 12 Infinite Life Sutra, as Spoken by the Buddha (one worthy of offerings), Anuttara Samyaksamuddha (one with supreme perfect enlightenment), Vidyacarana-Samanna (one perfect in wisdom and action), Sugata (well-gone one), Lokavid (one who knows the world), Anuttara (unsurpassed leader), Purusa Damya Sarathi (trainer of men), Sasta Devamanusyanam (teacher of devas and humans), and BuddhaBhagavat (the enlightened, world-honored one). “At that time, there was a king who heard the Dharma teaching of the Buddha. With a joyful heart, he awakened the aspiration to supreme, perfect enlightenment. He abandoned his kingdom and throne, and became a monk with the Dharma name of Dharmakara. He had preeminent talent, courage and intelligence, surpassing all others in the world. “When he reached Tathagata Lokesvararaja, he bowed at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated the Buddha clockwise three times, and prostrated himself on the ground. With palms pressed together, he acclaimed in verse: Your countenance glows with supreme majesty; Your divinity is mighty and boundless. Such brilliance Is without equal. The sun, the moon and muni-gems, Though in pearly luster and fiery glare, Are all bereft of brightness Like blocks of ink. First Fascicle 13 Your visage, Tathagata, Peerlessly transcends the world.

In precepts, learning, diligence, samadhi and wisdom, Your sublimity and virtue are unparalleled, Outstanding and rare. With deep observation and perfect reflection On the oceanic Dharma of all Buddhas, You embrace its profundity and subtlety, And penetrate its utmost breadth and depth. Ignorance, desire and anger Are forever absent from you, World-Honored One. You are a hero among men, a lion among beasts; Your divine virtue is infinite. Your feats are vast, Your wisdom is penetrating and wondrous. Your light and your noble features Shake the Great Chiliocosms. I vow to become a Buddha With the same sublimity as you, Dharma King.

I vow to attain Buddhahood And fulfill this vow universally, Turning all fears \[of sentient beings\] Into great peace. Suppose there are Buddhas Millions of kotis in number, And countless great sages As many as grains of sand in the Ganges River. Making offerings To all these Buddhas Cannot compare with seeking the Way With determination and perseverance. Like the sands of the Ganges, Buddha Lands are numerous. Also innumerable beyond measure Are other worlds and realms. My light shall shine universally Through all these lands. With such avid diligence, My divine power shall be hard to measure.

>If we practice Dharma depending on ordinary substance linagea power, we cannot have deep spiritual power. The source of visible power is always invisible power. For example, some machines are very powerful, but we cannot see or touch the electricity that runs through them because the source of its power is invisible. If we cannot connect visible substance power to its invisible substanceless source, then it is quickly exhausted. This is especially true today when Easterners and Westerners are making Dharma factories, trying to bargain with substance lineage for power and gain… We think that lineage must be exclusive, only for those who accumulate spiritual prestige.

Unless we are nihilists and believe only in the visible, we cannot judge the spiritual qualities of someone who has no visible teacher in this life… Of course, for most people lineage depends on a visible teacher, and in general, if we can find a good teacher it is necessary to have a guide. But according to the Buddhist tradition, if we believe in karma, we believe that because some people had a visible teacher in previous lives and have experience with the pure essence of their elements, they can be reborn to become enlightened without depending on a visible teacher in this life.

Every time I witness death, even something as little as accidentally squishing a bug, I feel so disturbed afterwards. The last time I purposefully harmed anything (an insect, years ago) I vowed to never feel that way again, like I was ""able"" to end the life of something and I now try my hardest to cause as little trouble to those around me as possible, no matter how small. The fragility of life scares me. If I am able to accidentally step on an ant and it stops existing, that's obviously how close I also am to oblivion.

""There comes a time, bhikkhus, when after the lapse of a long period this world contracts (disintegrates). While the world is contracting, beings for the most part are reborn in the Ābhassara Brahma-world.[7] There they dwell, mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the air, abiding in glory. And they continue thus for a long, long period of time.

Here Buddha explains that the whole galaxy will end and after it will expand again.(just like our big bang theory) There are many beings reborn in this abhaassara brahma world which is heaven. 


40. ""But sooner or later, bhikkhus, after the lapse of a long period, there comes a time when this world begins to expand once again. While the world is expanding, an empty palace of Brahmā appears. Then a certain being, due to the exhaustion of his life-span or the exhaustion of his merit, passes away from the Ābhassara plane and re-arises in the empty palace of Brahmā. There he dwells, mind made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the air, abiding in glory. And he continues thus for a long, long period of time.

41. ""Then, as a result of dwelling there all alone for so long a time, there arises in him dissatisfaction and agitation, (and he yearns): 'Oh, that other beings might come to this place!' Just at that moment, due to the exhaustion of their life-span or the exhaustion of their merit, certain other beings pass away from the Ābhassara plane and re-arise in the palace of Brahmā, in companionship with him. There they dwell, mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the air, abiding in glory. And they continue thus for a long, long period of time.


Thereupon the being who re-arose there first thinks to himself: 'I am Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Supreme Being, the Ordainer, the Almighty, the Father of all that are and are to be. And these beings have been created by me. What is the reason? Because first I made the wish: ""Oh, that other beings might come to this place!"" And after I made this resolution, now these beings have come.'

""And the beings who re-arose there after him also think: 'This must be Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Supreme Being, the Ordainer, the Almighty, the Father of all that are and are to be. And we have been created by him. What is the reason? Because we see that he was here first, and we appeared here after him.'

43. ""Herein, bhikkhus, the being who re-arose there first possesses longer life, greater beauty, and greater authority than the beings who re-arose there after him.

44. ""Now, bhikkhus, this comes to pass, that a certain being, after passing away from that plane, takes rebirth in this world. Having come to this world, he goes forth from home to homelessness. When he has gone forth, by means of ardor, endeavor, application, diligence, and right reflection, he attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life, but none previous to that. He speaks thus: 'We were created by him, by Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Supreme Being, the Ordainer, the Almighty, the Father of all that are and are to be. He is permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change, and he will remain the same just like eternity itself. But we, who have been created by him and have come to this world, are impermanent, unstable, short-lived, doomed to perish


Thus here they explained that because one of the heavenly being from a higher realm was dropped to another realm, he did not have his past memories, therefore he think he is the creator of the world. 

Shortly after all the beings that appear at the same realm with him thought that they were created by him as well. (angels?)

I would very much appreciate your take on whatever resonates with or stands out to you. 
From the reading that I’ve done since then and the people I talked to, my experience comes closest to what I read about in an article about Tibetan Buddhism (can’t find it anymore unfortunately), which is why I am posting here. That’s all I know.

A couple of years ago I had an experience where I detached from the regular understanding of my self: what I thought my body felt like was different, what my thoughts and convictions are weren’t of me anymore but outside of me, I experienced my feelings as a perfect agglomeration rather than one particular standing out, and after that step I experienced a sort of timelessness/(beginning/end being one) and being (a part of) the universe. It rid me of my decades long belief of feeling worthless and insignificant and I realized that I am part of all that is. 

To me, the experience was the most important experience of my life. Anything else before it has lost its “glow”, in a good and in a bad way. The good thing is that it’s not relevant to me anymore what has happened before. Things have just come to be until that experience kind of “wiped” the before “clean” (I don’t know how else to describe it). On the not so good side, what has come before also lost its meaning to me and so does what’s around me now.

I seem to not be able to bridge the understanding of existing within all else that is and valuing it as much to actually take part it in. After having experienced what I experienced I felt as if I can finally rest and I have found much deep inner peace. I see myself chill out while I watch everyone else run after something that I don’t understand (or can’t see because it’s within them) and it just feels foreign to me to see the world be a bit wacko (or so it seems to me while also knowing it makes sense that it is the way it is). There are many days (most days) that I am just waiting for the evening to arrive so that I can go to bed peacefully again. 
I don’t care anymore about the rest and that includes connecting with people and there have been times where I regretted not taking my life after the experience (my reasoning was that I was finally at peace and I’d be more than grateful to just end my life in this state and being grateful for all that was, rather than having to continue on and waiting for days, months, years to pass until I go).

The sort of inner drive is missing now but once in a while, when I watch others be excited about things or work on projects I wished I would be carried by this inner flow they seem to be carried by (and that I used to have with some things). But any time I try, I can’t keep it up for long, like an old car engine that gives up after trying to start it.

Am I just here to be a vegetable (but a happy vegetable) until I die?
And then I think: well what if I just fully commit to living life and chase everything that I want to do without letting lose - but wouldn’t that be against the idea of attachment?

Hi,

First of all, I am aware buddhists householders do not need to practice celibacy and only need to stick to the 5 precepts. I've seen similar posts to this get met with those answers, which I want to preemptively request, please do not mention this.

I am serious about the realisation of nirvana and would like to be a monk one day once I have established myself firmly in the 8 precepts on a regular basis as a householder.

One of the precepts in the 8 precepts is no sexual activity.

This one is a challenge as although I can refrain from sexual misconduct, and I do not have a partner, refraining from masturbation altogether is hard for me. I can do it for day, a few days, maybe a few weeks if I'm busy enough, but eventually I start becoming very horny and thinking about women and if I don't masturbate I even get thoughts about visiting a brothel or indulging in casual sex if available. I figure it's better to masturbate and maintain at least the 5 precepts, than go visit a brothel (which I believe to be encouraging a bad industry / unethical / breaking sexual misconduct precept).

The nofap community is full of weird claims and information as I'm sure you're aware, I do not want to visit that community to learn and sift through for any nuggets. I would like, from a buddhist perspective, perhaps if anyone knows of any suttas on what practical ways I can handle lust / celibacy short and long term?

- your mindstate during the action (if i remember right)

The problem is with that metaphor, we know how many crops we will get. Not exactly, because some seeds will fail, but we have a really good estimate.

But we will never get a chance to leverage our karma like that in a positive way.

I own books by Bhikkhu Thanisaro, Bhante Vimalaramsi (who promoted Metta above all else, but gave very little on continuing past that point), have heard lectures and instructions by Ajahn Brahm, Shravasti Dhammika, all oddly silent on any real instruction on this scriptural practice? I found an instruction on Metta from all of these men but none on progression through the Viharas.

Some might say ""well just do what the Suttas say"", but if I was to compare my practice of Metta just based on the Sutta, and then with all the practical advice from Vimalaramsi, you know how much a good example or strong Dharma talk can help you understand better. The Suttas are too difficult for me to apply. It's not so simple to just say ""project the feeling of Upekkha"" when I don't have a clear conception of it or a reliable way to trigger it. I need some extra assistance.

The Theravada teachers in my area were no help, one white lay teacher who admitted he had never practiced these, and a Thai monk who's English frankly was not well enough to help, though he encouraged me to reach out and ask around.

This suggests that engaging in different activities doesn't necessarily disrupt the meditation process, allowing one to resume where they left off.

Would this also be possible if you only meditate like 2 or 3 hours a day, while doing your 8 hour job in between (like computer work)? 

And do some people have experienced deep jhana states with only meditating a few hours a day?

Let me do y'all a favor by giving my 2 cents:

1. **If you're a Buddhist & believe in Rebirth**: According to both Theravada & Mahayana, considering the countless number of lives we have wandered in the beginningless Samsara, it is definitely the case that all beings have been our mother in our past lives at least once. Now, if you consider its implication then, having sex with anybody means having sex with our past-life mother. It is like your present-life mother put on a different skin-suit & skin-mask and acting like a completely different person while having sex with you. Technically, having sex with anybody is committing ""incest.""

2. **If you don't believe in rebirth, but you believe in science**: According to human genetics, we all share a common great......great grand mother named the Mitochondrial Eve. Its implications is that we all are technically half-siblings & children of half-siblings. It is good to know we all are related & one big family. BUT.....It also means everybody (except for the celibates) has been committing ""incest"" by marrying, copulating, and having children with each other.

Logically speaking, from Buddhist moral and most countries' law standards, all non-celibates are secretly sinners & criminals.

As someone with a lot of anxiety, especially around illness and the dying process, I have tried to meditate on these subjects more. I have been reading [Thanissaro Bhikku's 'Undaunted'](https://www.dhammatalks.org/books/Undaunted/Section0001.html) as a resource to get a deeper understanding of the concepts and practices behind meditating on death and dying. As a product of my anxiety, I often find when I am going through the deep of it, I live a week at a time, sometimes a day at a time, as if I have a terminal illness (in my case, this is unfortunately involuntary). I try to make the best of these circumstances by practicing mindfulness and trying to appreciate all that I have in the present moment, as it is. However, I find that being in this state is stressful, and having a constant stream of cortisol running through me is definitely not healthy long-term.

I am wondering how Buddhists normally square with this. Meditating on death can be very stressful, and from what I understand, a big part of the practice is to learn to navigate such feelings with acceptance and equanimity. I would like to be able to develop the fortitude to navigate these waters in earnest, as if to prepare myself for when it inevitably happens -- but I also know that the stress manifested in this process is apparently harmful as well.

Can one meditate and practice on these 'grim' topics from a healthy space, or is the anxiety and stress a necessary component of the process? For the sake of my children, I want to live as long as possible to provide for them, but a part of the process of meditating on death forces a sense of proximity, and that proximity can be very challenging. I am sometimes worried it is making me sicker.

Can anyone explain this from a Buddhist perspective?

When I was first introduced to spiritual/wellness/new age beliefs, I was constantly watching and reading content/books/texts that felt very energizing and inspiring. The resonance was very heart-felt. However, I began to spiral deeper into my bad habits and vices. It felt very unbalanced, as if I was bouncing back and forth between extremes. I found that my compassion towards myself was growing in some ways, while new insecurities were being formed in others. I feel that I was losing touch with the deeper part of myself, my creativity, my humanity-- not fully, but I felt dampened. I experienced a lot of interesting energy and dynamics at this time which spanned the course of about three years. I was ""on this journey"" with a couple other special people in my life.

I went through a traumatic experience that caused me to completely disconnect from my spirituality and I became very inquisitive of my beliefs, skeptical, and began to deconstruct and divest from the new age sphere. I'm still trying to come back to my spiritual beliefs and make sense of the world.
I've been trying to let go and accept that I don't know, I will probably never know, and it doesn't really matter. I want to be present for life, practice compassion, build community, follow my passions, and connect with Nature. I've always been very fond of Buddhism, it feels very grounding.

I don't really have anyone in my life that I can talk about this to, and sometimes I don't know what to think or believe about my past experiences and beliefs. I'm trying to practice using better discernment, but I am not very skilled. I still struggle with attachments and bad habits, but not as extreme.

Then one day I just watched a video about the history of the buddha and how one of his first followers was supposedly a murderer, and it got me thinking that maybe I had a chance to be better. I started to notice more stories about horrible people becoming better. In the very texts I read I rediscovered many such stories I never took into heart.

I have recently just had enough after years of fighting with life. 

I went from being catholic, to atheist, to agnostic, and now while I’ll always keep an agnostic side, I think Buddhism fits with what I believe.

I want to take action to fix my life. I have believed in “Enlightenment” for years but always kind of not taken it seriously. I even thought that “It’s probably just something that happens in the brain”.

I know that Science can only explain this experience and there’s beyond that. 

 Now I’m fully invested. What I believe in is basically Nonduality/Spirituality (not the chakra bs kind).

I think the teachings of Buddhism are also interested but I’m really focused on the mystical side of it.

I believe every religion is using metaphors to explain “Enlightenment”.

I really don’t know anything about Buddhism though or any other religion, I just know that taking the stories of Christianity literally (like Noah’s arch) is not for me.

Every time we wash our hands, we are exterminating millions or billions of microbial beings. Whenever we do so much as harvest an ear of corn, we are probably crushing a tiny bug or two. And what about our own cells? Do they count as living beings? Not to mention, plants are obviously living beings too, but we obviously would not be able to live unless we ate them. Mahavira, the founder of Jainism, went as far as to say that we should not even *step on grass* for fear of damaging it. If you ask me, this is going a bit too far - avoiding stepping on all living beings such as plants (and they are everywhere if you go outside) does not seem like a sustainable or reasonable way to live.

So, perhaps this ties into ""right intention"". Maybe what the Buddha meant is that we should not go about life with the *intention* of killing or injuring living beings. But even this can be interpreted loosely.

I was raised Nichiren Buddhist by my grandmother, and we would practice at an SGI center when I was younger. As I got older, covid hit, and we stopped attending regularly. I was never really super into religion when I was a kid so I never payed much attention in youth meetings. I'm 18 now, and we recently started going back more regularly. 

A while ago, I was talking with an older colleague from work, and he mentioned that he was a Lay Ordained Zen Buddhist that practiced at his local Zen Center. I had never really heard about the other branches of Buddhism so I was excited and wanted to ask some questions but after I told him that I was Nichiren Buddhist and practiced at an local SGI center he didn't respond to my text.

I was never taught much about different practices and how they work/differ, so I was worried I had disrespected him in some way, and so I started looking into both of our branches of Buddhism. 

Everything seemed pretty chill until I started looking on this subreddit, which comparies SGI to the prosperity gospel and Mormons, which completely blindsided me.

I saw people saying they could be culty and think that their branch of Buddhism is the only correct one. This hasn't been my experience but if there's something going on I'd really like to know. 

the general Buddhist community in my state is very small. I've always thought of things as a Buddhist is a Buddhist, branches don't matter much as that was the general vibe I picked up from my community. But I've never heard much of different branches or met someone that practiced Buddhism outside of SGI.

He also has general anxiety, as well as a people-pleasing sort of anxiety. He behaves overly nice and polite. He can be highly considerate of others, and is always wanting to serve. He is aware of this tendency & I think he embraces it and knowingly cultivates it (which is an interesting endeavor, but seems to cause other issues).

Behind this type of anxiety is often a critical voice that says, ""Do this, don't do this, dress properly, wake up early, take proper care of the things you own, don't be late, apologize for everything, don't say anything that could be taken the wrong way ...."" A lot of these thoughts sound helpful, but they don't sound so helpful when he says them out loud, as unsolicited advice to me, his younger brother.

I get the sense that he has attached some of his own aversions to his idea of who I am. Maybe I said or did some things that he didn't like, and from that he built his own version of me which is worse than the real thing, and now he's unreasonably harsh and critical towards me. He laughs or scoffs at my words and behavior when we are in a group. At first, it would catch me off guard. His comments/reactions would come from nowhere, and they would change my mood and really stick with me afterwards. By now, I know to expect these comments and I feel like I'm walking on eggshells to not say anything that could be criticized. But it's not helping. It doesn't matter how I act or what I say, I still get this derisiveness from him. It seems clear that the problem comes from him, not me.

As a result, his critical voice is often in my head throughout the day. Telling me to be more responsible, more careful. Just based on a few past comments. I'm always working on mindfulness in daily life, but usually I just get reactive to these thoughts and argue with him in my head.

But how to become less reactive isn't my question here. I'm wondering how to handle this. It sucks having a sibling who has something against you. He's a good person, but the unexpected barbs have been unhelpful

Does anybody have any experience with this? I don't want to interrupt my healing process. I am aware that I'm not these experiences, and that I'm not defined by them, but there are still some troubling dreams I have and day-to-day life problems that arise which are linked to unintegrated traumatic experiences. Any insights on how to deal with trauma,  while learning how to perceive the true reality are highly appreciated, thank you for your time and consideration.

- Siddhartha Gautama was a man or a god

- Buddhists worship him or other Buddhas

I’m fairly new to studying Buddhism, and my current understanding is that Mahayana Buddhists consider Gautama Buddha to be a god and they worship him, while Theravada Buddhists treat him more like a wise human who we should emulate but not worship.

Yet, the statement remains from Buddhists that one must live in the moment. If this is to be taken seriously, you would understand the past as a collection of sensations. But then that needs no room for reflection on those sensations. Therefore the past cannot be considered a hinderance or distraction but needs to be considered as a fully fledged and living past.

I find it accessible to dispel my hatred when I remember these lines from The Dhammapada:

>**3.** ""He abused me, he struck me, he overpowered me, he robbed me."" Those who harbor such thoughts do not still their hatred.  
>  
>**4.** ""He abused me, he struck me, he overpowered me, he robbed me."" Those who do not harbor such thoughts still their hatred.

>**6.** There are those who do not realize that one day we all must die. But those who do realize this settle their quarrels.

But practically, when I am faced with a situation in which I am being targeted with malevolence, I find it hard to abstain from hatred. I feel that it is wrong, it's unfair, etc.

However, I can dispel it in that moment when I reflect upon the suffering of the other person. They have a reason for why they are acting in this unwholesome way, and it is because of their suffering. Their actions are suffering. We all have to struggle with the downsides of human nature.

This trick doesn't work if I can't understand why a person is so malicious. If a person seems to be sadistically enjoying harming me, I find this especially infuriating. It's like, in my mind they're no longer a person. I can humanize a person when I know of their suffering. But, for these types of people, as I perceive them, there is no pain inside of them that I can see or understand. I just see them as basically pure evil, like sadistic harm machines. I feel fear and avoidance of being abused at that point.

And what I find most troubling about these kinds of people, is the way that I react to them.

So, I'm requesting some guidance in how I could have compassion for these people, or at least not react with hatred and anger. Yes, mindfulness and seeing it clearly of course.

If we agree that everything in the observable universe is made up of physical matter and nothing more or supernatural, then how could we claim the existence of other realms and deities?

I’ve heard the claim on this sub before that some think that many deities are just manifested as psychological states like rage or that other realms like the hungry ghost realm is just a mindset of people that are greedy or something. A korean seon monk once even told me that the pure land is something you reach through consistent and dilligent meditation in your mind, and that that experience is what’s real about it (something along those lines according to what she knew).

I’ve also heard the contrary, that deity figures with supernatural powers exist, (except we have no way of physically verifying that). I’m just confused if this is an issue of people centuries ago merging Buddhist teachings with local theistic/animistic traditions in certain areas of the world, or if there’s a canonical assertion of the supernatural, what’s outside the domain of scientific inquiry. 

I’m a bit agnostic on the matter, since absence of the supernatural in what we observe doesn’t mean it’s nonexistent, so I’m open to different information I may not have considered.

Hey, y'all. So, I believe in the way of the Buddha. His teaching has a lot of substance and quality, and his eightfold path is enlightening. However, I have this issue between standards and Desires; there needs to be more clarity as I am relatively new and not a scholar of this branch of theistic philosophy.

In my life, I believe that people use me, and I don't retaliate for my uncaring attitude and general perseverance and do not further the spiral of hatred; however, Buddhism for me (form my interpretation of my source, interpretation by meaning the author who elaborates on the Buddha's teaching to clear any confusion,) encouraged this mentality and later on furthered my actions and beliefs with this. However, I am complacent with the things around me and let this happen to me- albeit I have no control over it, and there is nothing to do for the time- and I should accept it. But I am not even mad; I have no anger towards them, which is an essential part of the human experience, no? I allow this and keep it continuing. I feel like I'll fall down the same hole again of letting someone mistreat me and being okay with it and just staying complacent with no desires. I should value myself to be more than that and *want* more. So that's the question, is having standards implicitly the same as wanting/desires. 

This interpretation of Buddhism encourages this. However, as stated before, I am very green when referring to Buddhism. So, I may have misinterpreted the teachings. I wish to further my knowledge of this branch of philosophy.

I've been into Buddhism for a while now, and recently started attending meditation classes at my local buddhist centre which is a Triratna centre. I am aware of the controversy behind Triratna but all the people I met there were so nice and welcoming,  and after doing a few retreats, I signed up for the first year of their mitra study course, as a way to make new friends. However,  I have been a bit concerned by some of their teachings and way of doing things - its a bit culty -  with over focus on the mystical aspects  of Buddhism rather than insight, and their desire to continually attract new members (who they then tell have to commit to Triratna) and focus on connection, positivity and arts, spiritual work etc.  

And I think the study course is not really teaching the dharma correctly, as I suspected - its seems more influenced by the western romantic tradition rather than actual Buddhism. I am not sure what to do. Should I just quit? Issue is I have made many close friends who are nice people. I was thinking to continue the study course but debate issues I don't agree with - and thereby improve mine and others understanding? Its not all bad there are some good bits.

35y/o male, I am/was a full fledged 'covert' narcissist, I managed to get a glimpse outside the false self after a psychotic episode while 'meditating' on cannabis and since then iv been oscillating between being present and becoming the narcissist again. I have continued to meditate without cannabis and it has brought me closer to the 'wound' which caused me to become a narcissist, there are still only fragments but if what these pieces and my dreams are telling me is accurate then I was raped by my alcoholic father somewhere between 3-6 years old. My back feels like it is broken, and my body feels like it is twisted (which funnily enough correlates to the twisted thoughts and desires iv had in my life). The further into this I have gone, the more my life has fallen apart - all of my narcissistic supply has left me and my self awareness stops me from seeking anymore. I feel like I'm dying, and I fear that I will be overcome by the fear, lonliness and inability to authentically connect with others, and the pain will drive me to suicide.

My question is, according to Buddhism, if I kill myself, will I reincarnate as a narcissist again? Even if I don't kill myself, but don't manage to miraculously heal my inner wounds before I die 'naturally'. Essentially, am I stuck forever in a sort of 'living death loop'? Iv heard healing from narcissism is impossible because the trauma suffered was so extreme and inflicted so early in life.

I have always been curious about why some people chose Theravada, or Mahayana while others chose Vajrayana as their main set of beliefs and why not other branches of Buddhism. This isn't a thread meant to say that all branches are bad apart from the person's branch but to show their opinions. 

I'll do mine first:

Though I'm new to this, I am more comfortable with Vajrayana Buddhism. The rituals, the ways of meditation, chanting, etc are meant for the person to achieve Enlightenment (becoming a Bodhisattva) much quicker though being difficult without a suitable lama or even dangerous. It's a main characteristic that suits my beliefs as it is faster to be able to relieve all the suffering of other beings. It's also why Theravada never interested me despite it being considered as the most traditional path, it would take eons to attain Enlightenment and I was turned down by this concept immediately. I don't want to offend anybody, it's like taking 50 lifetimes that would take 80 to probably 16 million years in another realm to become a doctor for all suffering beings rather than taking only one lifetime. It's not something that I'd take into practice.

 I do know that a lot of the practice does require empowerment from a lama to start or make the effects much better to ripen. Another thing is also that visualization practices are kind of great, I don't know how these practices helped me work- Maybe the actual process of visualization helps me more to concentrate on the meditation and so it's a lot more effective to use after my meditation practice. That also includes reciting open mantras (Om Mani Padme Hum or Om Tare Tuttare Ture Svaha) during my meditation.

I understand that some people don't choose Vajrayana due to the number of ceremonies that are necessary to prepare for more difficult practices (like wrathful deities, high tantra, etc.) and again I'm not trying to say that ""Vajrayana is the correct path to Enlightenment"".

I follow the commandments of the Torah, believe in one G-d, etc. Over the years, I have grown a deep love for the Buddha's teachings. This began through basic mindfulness meditation, which I began practicing almost daily years ago. Later I began reading books about the Buddhas teachings and Buddhist psychology. Tonight, for the first time, I went to a Buddhist temple to attend a meditation session led by a monk. There were aspects I really enjoyed; the loving-kindness meditation, walking meditation, and breath meditation. However, there were aspects that made me feel very uncomfortable.  In the beginning, it seemed like a prayer was being made to the Buddha (or at least the giant statue of the Buddha placed in the temple). At the end, everyone bowed on their hands and knees to the Buddha statue. Both of these things I could not do; as a Jew, we are forbidden to ""worship false idols,"" and while I am not saying the Buddha is an idol, I cannot bow to a statue, and I cannot pray to anything except G-d. As a Jew, my relationship with G-d should be through the Torah, not through a figure. However, I also love the Buddha; as I said, I love his teachings. I left this meditation tonight, feeling like I can't go back there, I left feeling that my relationship with Buddhism is on pause.  I would appreciate any thoughts or ideas as to how I can go forward on my path without abandoning my religious values.

The brothers who cultivate blessings do good deeds, give alms, build bridges, pave roads, relieve the poor, and serve others every day, but they do not seek to understand the meaning of the scriptures and develop wisdom; the brothers who cultivate wisdom only study the scriptures, explore the truth, and promote the Dharma, but do not work hard Do not want to serve others. The two brothers have their own specializations, but the results they obtained are very different.

The younger brother cultivated his fortune and was reborn as an elephant in the palace. Although he is in the animal realm, he is very blessed. He is given delicious food every day, covered with gold and silver, and has many elephant slaves to serve him. The blessings are many times better than those in the human world. Senior brother cultivates wisdom but not merit. Although he has attained the fruit of Arhat, he has not contributed any service to others in his past life, has not formed any connections with others, and has no merits and destinies. Therefore, although his thoughts are transcendent and his wisdom is extraordinary, his life is difficult, and he is begging for food everywhere. People support.

One day, the senior brother went to the palace to ask for alms. Seeing an elephant, the senior brother who had achieved ""clairvoyance"" looked at it and said, ""Oh! Isn't this my reincarnated junior brother?"" Therefore, he realized a truth. It turns out that when we, two senior brothers, were practicing in the past life, One only cultivates blessings, and the other only cultivates wisdom, so the causes and effects of blessings and wisdom are different for each. So, he made a verse: ""If you cultivate blessings without cultivating wisdom, an elephant will wear a necklace; if you cultivate wisdom without cultivating blessings, the arhat will have a poor supply."" This means that if the junior brother cultivates blessings without cultivating wisdom, even though he is reborn in the palace, Although I enjoy wealth and splendor, I am still in the animal realm and cannot listen to the Dharma. I am cultivating wisdom but not merit. Although I have become an Arhat, my life is difficult and I don’t even have enough food and clothing.

From this story, we can see that the most important thing in practicing Buddhism is to ""cultivate together with compassion and wisdom."" What is cultivating blessings? For example, building bridges and paving roads, providing tea and water on the road, and erecting street lights are all blessings. Another example is paying attention to environmental protection, not littering, and taking care of the safety of pedestrians. This is also blessing. Saving money and not wasting money on daily basis is of course also a blessing; solving problems for others and helping others out of trouble are both a blessing. In addition, worshiping Buddha and Bodhisattvas respectfully is a blessing.

What is cultivating wisdom? Reading classics and studying Buddhism is cultivating wisdom. When you listen to the Dharma, meditate on the Dharma, and practice the Dharma, it is precisely the so-called ""pursuing listening, contemplating, and cultivating practice to enter samadhi"" and you have cultivated wisdom.

People who practice the Bodhisattva path should not be partial to one method. They should pay equal attention to practice and interpretation, integrate knowledge and action, and listen to the same thing. They should integrate the Buddha's teachings. They should be compassionate when they are compassionate, give when they are giving, and when they are forming a relationship. We need to help others when they need our help. If we can practice together with blessings and wisdom, and pay equal attention to practice and interpretation, from now on all Buddhist teachings will be complete and harmonious, are we still afraid that we will not have a perfect life in the future?

Or just general knowledge to impart. 

I was raised as a Christian but have long had a problem with it; much (most) of it did not make logical sense to me. 

My understanding of Buddhism in my very limited reading is that there is no belief in a deity or creator. In this way it seems very science-friendly. It seems to me that the goal is mindfulness and appreciation of the present moment bearing in mind that death can come at any moment and is unavoidable (of course). 

I would like to learn more about beliefs of afterlife. What I’ve read so far indicates that perhaps there are heaven and hell-like places between death and rebirth but that these are always temporary? I’m also confused about nirvana. Is this a “destination” once one has attained enlightenment? 

I’m new and would appreciate understanding if I am confused on any of these points. This is the first belief system that has felt like perhaps it could fit for me and I am excited to learn more. I appreciate everyone’s help and thoughts 🌸 I am learning 🌷
